Blind Assessment
Deep-toned, straightforward and savory-leaning. Fresh humus, cocoa powder, gardenia extract, pecan, fir in aroma and cup. Savory, low-toned acidity; crisply satiny mouthfeel. Gently drying finish centered around notes of fresh humus, pecan and fir.
Notes
Produced by smallholding members of the Koperasi Ketiara Cooperative, a longtime origin partner of Colectivo. Coffees like this one from the northern part of the Indonesian island of Sumatra are valued for their complex earth and fruit notes that appear to result largely from unorthodox fruit removal and drying practices called “wet-hulling.” Certifications: USDA Organic; Fair Trade International. Colectivo Coffee, founded in 1993, is a Milwaukee-based specialty roaster with 20 cafes in Milwaukee, Madison, and Chicago. Visit www.colectivocoffee.com for more information.
Bottom Line This Sumatra displays the origin’s characteristically earthy notes — sweetly savory, low-toned and deep.Explore Similar CoffeesClick here for more reviews from Colectivo CoffeeClick here for more information about coffees from Sumatra

Exuberantly aromatic, rich, very complex. Bergamot, Concord grape, ginger blossom, pistachio, lychee in aroma and cup. Juicy-bright, exceptionally high-toned acidity; lush, silky mouthfeel. Rich, pungent, crisply sweet finish.
Notes
Produced by Diego Bermudez, from trees of the original Panama T.2722 cultivar of the Geisha variety of Arabica, and processed by the double-anaerobic washed method, in which the coffee fruit, after having been first sanitized with ozone, undergoes two stages of fermentation. First, the whole cherries are submerged under water for 48 hours, then the beans are pulped and fermented with a strain of Lactobacillus for 24 hours. After fermentation, the beans are given a “thermal shock” using hot and cold rinses to help the beans absorb the fermentation metabolites and halt any further fermentation. Afterward, the washed parchment coffee is rapidly dried with an in-house designed Eco-Enigma dehumidifying dryer to avoid over oxidation or continued fermentation. Paradise prides itself on quality and freshness, craft-roasting coffees in small batches only after orders are placed. Visit paradiseroasters.com or call 763-433-0626 for more information.

Notes
Produced from trees of the rare Ethiopia-derived botanical variety Gesha (also Geisha) by Adam and Rachel Overton. With its generally elongated beans and distinctive floral and crisp, often chocolaty cup, the Gesha variety continues to distinguish itself as one of the world’s most unique coffees. Although the Gesha variety originated in Ethiopia, it was “discovered” by the coffee world in 2004 growing in Boquete, Panama. This particular version, however, is the outcome of efforts to commercialize Gesha in the region from which it originally came. It is processed by the natural method (dried in the whole fruit). Kakalove Café is a nano-roaster located in the small city of Chia-Yi in Taiwan that strives to procure and roast the finest quality coffee.

Notes
Produced by Wilton Benitez of La Macarena Farm, entirely of the Yellow Geisha variety of Arabica, and processed by a complexly detailed version of the double-anaerobic method (sealed-tank fermentation of the whole fruit with the addition of brewer’s yeast, removal of skin and pulp, and a second fermentation of the beans shut in the tank with the removed skin and pulp). Additional processing nuance includes a thermal shock wash (soaking the whole fruit in hot water for 30 seconds, then cold water for 30 seconds) to reduce astringency. Founded in 2013, modcup coffee focuses on fresh roasting and distinctive natural-processed coffees. Visit modcup.com for more information.
Bottom Line This intense fruit and floral bomb, tempered only by aromatic wood notes, is interesting for its experimental processing, and offers clear appeal for devotees of fruity, floral coffees.

Notes
Produced from trees of the rare Ethiopia-derived botanical variety Gesha (also Geisha) by Adam and Rachel Overton. With its generally elongated beans and distinctive floral and crisp, often chocolaty cup, the Gesha variety continues to distinguish itself as one of the world’s most unique coffees. Although the Gesha variety originated in Ethiopia, it was “discovered” by the coffee world in 2004 growing in Boquete, Panama, and Panama continues to dominate the expanding world of Gesha. This particular version, however, is the outcome of efforts to commercialize Gesha in the region from which it originally came. It is processed by the natural method (dried in the whole fruit). VERYTIME is a specialty nano-roaster based in Taoyuan, Taiwan. Visit www.verytime.com.tw/ for more information.

Roasty-sweet, floral-toned. Honeysuckle, date, scorched birch, dark chocolate, Meyer lemon zest in aroma and cup. Crisp, juicy acidity; satiny-smooth mouthfeel. Chocolaty finish with undertones of lemon and honeysuckle.
Notes
Produced from trees of the rare Ethiopia-derived botanical variety Gesha (also Geisha) by Adam and Rachel Overton. With its generally elongated beans, and distinctive floral and crisp, often chocolaty cup, the Gesha variety continues to distinguish itself as one of the world’s most unique coffees. Although the Gesha variety originated in Ethiopia, it was “discovered” by the coffee world in 2004 growing in Boquete, Panama, and Panama continues to dominate the expanding world of Gesha. This particular version, however, is the outcome of efforts to commercialize Gesha in the region from which it originally came. It is processed by the washed method (fruit skin and pulp removed before drying). GK Coffee is a nano-roastery in Yilan, Taiwan, that offers both retail and wholesale coffee. For more information, visit www.gkcoffee.com.tw or email [email protected].
Bottom Line A surprisingly bright dark-roasted Ethiopia Gesha with a throughline of pretty florals and rich chocolate notes.Explore Similar CoffeesClick here for more reviews from GK CoffeeClick here for more information about coffees from EthiopiaVisit GK Coffee

Complex, deep-toned. Apricot, pink grapefruit zest, salted caramel, cedar, lemon thyme in aroma and cup. Crisp, sweetly tart structure with juicy acidity; satiny mouthfeel. Finish consolidates to notes of pink grapefruit, apricot and cedar.

Notes
Produced from trees of the rare Ethiopia-derived botanical variety Gesha (also Geisha) by Adam and Rachel Overton. With its generally elongated beans and distinctive floral and crisp, often chocolaty cup, the Gesha variety continues to distinguish itself as one of the world’s most unique coffees. Although the Gesha variety originated in Ethiopia, it was “discovered” by the coffee world in 2004 growing in Boquete, Panama, and Panama continues to dominate the expanding world of Gesha. This particular version, however, is the outcome of efforts to commercialize Gesha in the region from which it originally came. It is processed by the washed method (fruit skin and pulp removed before drying). Bargain Cafe is a specialty coffee roaster in Taitung, Taiwan. Visit https://shopee.tw/iamjiter for more information.
Bottom Line  A washed Ethiopia redolent of stone fruit and salted caramel; juicy-sweet and rich.

Delicately fruit-forward, complex, multi-layered. Bergamot, lychee, honeysuckle, lemon verbena, sandalwood in aroma and cup. Bright, richly bittersweet structure with high-toned acidity; full, syrupy mouthfeel. Integrated, flavor-laden finish.
Notes
Produced by Wilton Benitez entirely of the Geisha variety of Arabica. Processed by the kōji method, in which the coffee fruit is first sterilized and then fermented in a bio-reactor and inoculated with a selection of Japanese kōji (Aspergillus oryzae). This mold species breaks down starch into simple sugars and is commonly used in the production of soy sauce, miso, sake and shōchū. After whole-fruit fermentation, the coffee is pulped and subjected to a second fermentation phase. A bean-sealing process follows, carried out through impacts of hot and cold water, before the beans are dried by machine for 46 hours. Founded in 2013, modcup coffee focuses on fresh roasting and distinctive natural-processed coffees. Visit modcup.com for more information.

Floral and spice grandeur in a balanced anaerobic. Big, sweet, soaring, perfumy/spicy. Coriander, loquat, marjoram, cocoa, and a range of intense, spicy flowers in aroma and cup. Quite sweet but brightly tangy in structure, with a hint of savory depth. Creamy, lively mouthfeel. The finish is resonant, balanced and lasting. 
Notes
Produced by JN Farms from trees of the Red Bourbon variety of Arabica, and processed by a malolactic fermentation method designed by Miguel Meza, in which whole fruit is inoculated with both yeasts and malolactic bacteria, then fermented in anaerobic conditions for about a week before fruit and pulp are removed and the beans are dried in the fruit flesh or mucilage. Paradise prides itself on quality and freshness, craft-roasting coffees in small batches only after orders are placed. Visit www.paradiseroasters.com or call 763-433-0626 for more information.

Notes
Produced by Diego Samuel Bermudez Tapia of El Paraiso Farm from trees of the Castillo, Colombia and Caturra varieties of Arabica, and processed by the double-anaerobic method: Whole fruit is fermented in hermetically sealed tanks for 24 hours before the skins are removed.

Exuberant yet coherent anaerobic. Butterscotch, blueberry, cocoa, lilac, candycap mushroom in aroma and cup. Sweet, tart and savory impulses balance in a richly expressive structure. Plush, lightly syrupy mouthfeel. Fruit notes consolidate in a long though quiet finish.
Notes
Produced by Wilton Benitez of Finca El Paraíso entirely of the rare Pink Bourbon variety of Arabica, and processed by a complexly detailed version of the double-anaerobic method (sealed-tank fermentation of the whole fruit with the addition of brewer’s yeast, removal of skin and pulp, and a second fermentation of the beans shut in the tank with the removed skin and pulp). Additional processing nuance includes a thermal shock wash (soaking the whole fruit in hot water for 30 seconds, then cold water for 30 seconds) to reduce astringency.

An almost sugary-sweet, explosively herby and floral anaerobic. Rosemary, pink peppercorn, star jasmine, apricot yogurt, stone fruit in aroma and cup. Very sweet in structure with a tart edge; plush, supple mouthfeel. Yogurt and herb dominate the sweet finish.
Notes
Produced by Wilder Lazo of Finca Bella Alejandria entirely of the Gesha/Geisha variety of Arabica, and processed by a version of the honey or semi-washed anaerobic method: after the removal of the fruit skin and pulp, but with the flesh or mucilage still on the bean, the coffee is fermented in hermetically sealed tanks for 200 hours.

Intense, eccentric anaerobic candy-bomb. Very sweet, intensely fruity and spicy. Bubblegum, musk, raspberry, pistachio, ginger in aroma and cup. Profoundly sweet in structure with a touch of delicately tart acidity. Velvety, lively mouthfeel. In the finish candyish notes fade and musky flowers come forward.
Notes
Produced by Sebastián Ramirez of Finca El Placer entirely of the Caturra variety of Arabica, and processed by a proprietary anaerobic method, in which 95% ripe and 5% semi-ripe cherries undergo two phases of fermentation. First, the coffee is fermented in the whole cherry in sealed 200-liter tanks for 120 hours at 18 degrees Celsius, with microorganisms present. Then, skins and pulp are removed, leaving some of the fruit flesh on the beans, which are fermented anaerobically for 72 hours with the addition of CO2. The coffee is then slow-dried for 15 days. Chromatic Coffee prides itself in doing everything in-house and meticulously, from printing its attractive bags to modifying equipment to sourcing and roasting its fine coffees.

Elegantly fruit-toned, tropical. Lychee, passionfruit, bergamot, star jasmine, lemon thyme in aroma and cup. Gently bright, sweet structure with high-toned acidity; very rich, buoyantly creamy mouthfeel. Long, lingering, integrated finish.
Notes
Produced by Wilton Benitez entirely of the Papayo variety of Arabica. Processed by the kōji method, in which the coffee fruit is first sterilized and then fermented in a bio-reactor and inoculated with a selection of Japanese kōji (Aspergillus oryzae). This mold species breaks down starch into simple sugars and is commonly used in the production of soy sauce, miso, sake and shōchū. After whole-fruit fermentation, the coffee is pulped and subjected to a second fermentation phase. A bean-sealing process follows, carried out through impacts of hot and cold water, before the beans are dried by machine for 46 hours at 38C (100F). Paradise prides itself on quality and freshness, craft-roasting coffees in small batches only after orders are placed. Visit www.paradiseroasters.com or call 763-433-0626 for more information.

Produced by Wilton Benitez entirely of the Pink Bourbon variety of Arabica and processed by a proprietary anaerobic fermentation method in which ​​the coffee fruit is first sterilized, then fermented anaerobically in the whole fruit with added microorganisms for 36 hours. After this fermentation in the whole fruit, the coffee is subjected to thermal shock (first a high temperature to swell the beans and allow the unique flavors and aromas from the initial anaerobic yeast fermentation to penetrate the seeds, then a cold temperature to constrict the beans and lock in those flavors and aromas). Finally, the whole cherries are carefully dried by machine until the beans reach 10.5% internal humidity.

Notes
Burundi is a small, landlocked country in the Great Lakes region of Central Africa. Most coffee is grown in the mountains of the north, bordering Rwanda. Benefiting from ideal growing conditions and large plantings of local strains of the heirloom Bourbon variety of Arabica, Burundi coffee has an excellent reputation, though it is better known in Europe than in the United States. This is a wet-processed or “washed” coffee, meaning the fruit skin and pulp were removed from the beans immediately after harvesting and before drying. Mystic Monk Coffee is a small-batch roaster associated with a Carmelite monastery located in the Rocky Mountains of northern Wyoming. The monks emphasize an artisan approach to roasting and a commitment to quality. Visit www.mysticmonkcoffee.com or call 877-751-6377 for more information.
Bottom Line A deep-toned, balanced, inviting Burundi — chocolaty and sweet, with undertones of magnolia and rich aromatic wood.Explore Similar CoffeesClick here for more reviews from Mystic Monk CoffeeClick here for more information about coffees from BurundiVisit Mystic Monk Coffee

Notes
Produced from trees of the rare Ethiopia-derived botanical variety Gesha (also Geisha) by Adam and Rachel Overton. With its generally elongated beans and distinctive floral and crisp, often chocolaty cup, the Gesha variety continues to distinguish itself as one of the world’s most unique coffees. Although the Gesha variety originated in Ethiopia, it was “discovered” by the coffee world in 2004 growing in Boquete, Panama, and Panama continues to dominate the expanding world of Gesha. This particular version, however, is the outcome of efforts to commercialize Gesha in the region from which it originally came. It was processed by the natural method (dried in the whole fruit).

Richly fruit-toned, cocoa-driven. Bing cherry, lychee, tangerine, cocoa nib, magnolia in aroma and cup. Very sweet, gently tart structure with juicy acidity; plush, viscous mouthfeel. Resonantly integrated, fruity and cocoa-toned finish.
Notes
This exceptional coffee was selected as the No. 14 coffee on Coffee Review’s list of the Top 30 Coffees of 2022. Produced from trees of the rare Ethiopia-derived botanical variety Gesha (also spelled Geisha) by Adam and Rachel Overton. With its generally elongated beans and distinctive floral and crisp, often chocolaty cup, the Gesha variety continues to distinguish itself as one of the world’s most unique coffees. Although the Gesha variety originated in Ethiopia, it was “discovered” by the coffee world in 2004 growing in Boquete, Panama, and Panama continues to dominate the expanding world of Gesha. This particular version, however, is the outcome of efforts to commercialize Gesha in the region from which it originally came. It is processed by the natural method (dried in the whole fruit). Corvus particularly focuses on processing methods and selective harvesting, which results in small, seasonal micro-lots of uniquely sweet, vibrant, and clean flavor profiles. For more information, visit www.corvuscoffee.com.
Bottom Line A decadent fruit-centered medley of stone fruit, tropical fruit, citrus and crisp cocoa nib with exceptionally vibrant acidity and mouthfeel.Explore Similar CoffeesClick here for more reviews from Corvus CoffeeClick here for more information about coffees from EthiopiaVisit Corvus Coffee

Delicately sweet-tarty, fruity and lively. Baking chocolate, pomegranate, lime zest, cashew butter, oak in aroma and cup. Sweet-tart structure with gently bright, winey acidity; crisp, silky mouthfeel. Baking chocolate and lime zest are central in the finish.
Notes
A blend of Typica, Red Bourbon and Red Catuai varieties of Arabica produced by Miranda Farms and JN Farms, processed using a proprietary method involving wine yeasts. The decaffeinated coffees were processed by Kona Decaf in Holualoa using pressurized carbon dioxide gas rather than chemical solvents to remove about 50% of the total caffeine, making this a “half-caf” coffee rather than a coffee decaffeinated using industrial methods that remove almost all of the caffeine. Paradise prides itself on quality and freshness, craft-roasting coffees in small batches only after orders are placed. Visit www.paradiseroasters.com or call 763-433-0626 for more information.
Bottom Line A partially decaffeinated coffee of exemplary quality and distinction.
Coffees of three traditional varieties are separately processed using Miguel Meza’s “champagne” method, blended, and subjected to partial decaffeination with no use of solvents. The result is a delightfully fruit-driven, chocolaty, low-caffeine cup. Explore Similar CoffeesClick here for more reviews from Paradise RoastersVisit Paradise Roasters

Delicately bright, resonantly floral. Narcissus, cardamom, honey, bergamot, marjoram in aroma and cup. Balanced, sweetly tart structure with vibrant acidity; lively, silky mouthfeel. The long, flavor-laden finish leads with notes of bittersweet citrus and narcissus in the short; cardamom and honey resurface in the long.
Notes
Produced from trees of the celebrated Ethiopia-derived botanical variety Geisha (also spelled Gesha) by farmer Roberto Brenes of Auromar Estate. With its generally elongated beans and distinctive floral and crisp, often chocolaty cup, the Geisha/Gesha variety continues to distinguish itself as one of the world’s most unique coffees. This is a dry-processed or “natural” version, meaning the beans were dried inside the fruit rather than after the fruit has been removed, as is the case with wet-processed or “washed” coffees. Now based in Henderson, Nevada, Dragonfly Coffee was named 2019 Micro-Roaster of the Year by Roast magazine.  Visit www.dragonflycoffeeroasters.com or call 303-579-2154 for more information.

Blind Assessment
Evaluated as espresso. Delicately berry-toned, richly sweet. Blackberry coulis, cocoa nib, agave syrup, fresh-cut cedar, macadamia nut in aroma and small cup. Silky, viscous mouthfeel; the finish leads with notes of agave syrup and macadamia nut. Especially pretty in cappuccino format, where berry and cocoa notes balance rich aromatic cedar.
Notes
Produced in the Guji growing region, an area nestled next to Ethiopia's better-known Yirgacheffe and Sidamo regions, largely from trees of distinctive indigenous landrace varieties of Arabica. Processed by the natural method (dried in the whole fruit). Modern Times is a well-loved, exuberantly inventive Point Loma, San Diego brewery that has long specialized in coffee-beer crossovers and overlaps. Visit www.moderntimescoffee.com for more information.
Bottom Line A quietly complex espresso, more a crescendo than a jolt in its easy going but confident profile.

Southern Ethiopia coffees like this one are largely produced from distinctive indigenous Ethiopian landrace varieties of Arabica long grown in their respective regions. This is a dry-processed or “natural” version, meaning the beans were dried inside the fruit rather than after the fruit has been removed, as is the case with wet-processed or “washed” coffees.

Notes
Yirgacheffe is a coffee region in southern Ethiopia that produces distinctive coffees from traditional landrace varieties of Arabica long grown in the region. This is a “natural” or dry-processed version, meaning the beans were dried inside the fruit, encouraging a flavor profile that is less predictable and deeper than the more familiar wet-processed floral- and citrus-toned Yirgacheffe profile.

Notes
Coffee from trees of the botanical variety Geisha (also Gesha) grown on Price Peterson’s Hacienda La Esmeralda in Panama first introduced this extraordinary variety of Arabica to the world. This is a wet-processed or “washed” version, meaning the fruit skin and pulp were removed from the beans immediately after harvesting but before drying. GK Coffee is a nano-roastery in Yilan, Taiwan that offers both retail and wholesale coffee. For more information, visit www.gkcoffee.com.tw or email [email protected].
Bottom Line A deftly darker-roasted Geisha cup with distinct notes of chocolate fudge throughout, supported by creamy nut and sweetly spicy flowers.Explore Similar CoffeesClick here for more reviews from GK CoffeeClick here for more information about coffees from PanamaVisit GK Coffee

Deeply fruit-toned, balanced and deep. Dark chocolate, goji berry, gardenia, hazelnut butter, fresh-cut cedar in aroma and cup. Richly sweet structure with gentle, balanced acidity; crisp, syrupy mouthfeel Resonantly chocolaty finish with undertones of goji berry and hazelnut.
Notes
Bourbon Pointu, botanical name var. Laurina, is a natural mutation of the famous Bourbon variety, first selected on Reunion Island in the Indian Ocean. The Bourbon Pointu is famous for its natural low levels of caffeine, bean shape (small and tending to be pointed at the ends, hence “pointu”), and pungently fruit-toned, Bourbon-like cup. This version was produced in Kona and is a dry-processed or “natural” coffee, meaning the beans were dried inside the fruit. Hula Daddy is a boutique coffee producer with farms at the 1,400 and 2,500-foot levels of the Mount Hualalai volcano near the northern end of the Kona growing district, five minutes above the town of Kailua-Kona. Visit www.huladaddy.com or call 888-553-2339 for more information.
Bottom Line Here a darker roast amplifies the intricate resonance of Hula Daddy’s rare Pointu Laurina, a naturally low-caffeine bean that sacrifices nothing in flavor.

Notes
This sample consists entirely of peaberries, a kind of bean that results when the coffee fruit develops a single, oval bean rather than the usual pair of flat-sided beans. Peaberries produce a somewhat different cup than normal beans from the same crop, from which they may or may not be separated during grading. Tanzania is particularly associated with its peaberry grades. Chaos Coffee Co. is based in Bayboro, North Carolina and offers artisan-roasted specialty coffee.

Notes

Crisply spice-toned. Nutmeg, clove, baking chocolate, date, fir in aroma
and cup. Sweetly savory with gentle acidity; satiny-smooth mouthfeel. Wood-framed finish supported by notes of baking spices.
Notes
Produced by Don Luis Campos of Cordillera del Fuego and processed by the “thermic” method, in which beans, with skins removed, are heated with some of the fruit flesh or mucilage still adhering to them. The exposure to heat starts to break down the natural sugars of the mucilage, partially caramelizing them. Battlecreek Coffee Roasters, founded in 2019, is a Battle Creek, Michigan specialty coffee roaster that donates a portion of all sales to organizations that provide counseling to victims of human trafficking. For more information, visit www.battlecreek.coffee.
Bottom Line Evocative of walking into an American bakery with its notes of nutmeg and clove, this Costa Rica coffee was processed by an innovative “thermic” method.Explore Similar CoffeesClick here for more reviews from Battlecreek Coffee RoastersClick here for more information about coffees from Costa Rica

Produced from trees of the rare Ethiopia-derived botanical variety Gesha (also Geisha) by Adam and Rachel Overton.

Although the Gesha variety originated in Ethiopia, it was “discovered” by the coffee world in 2004 growing in Boquete, Panama, and Panama continues to dominate the expanding world of Gesha. This particular version, however, is the outcome of efforts to commercialize Gesha in the region from which it originally came. It is processed by the natural method (dried in the whole fruit).

Notes
Folklore Coffee is a specialty roaster and bakeshop in the rural Montana town of Conrad. Produced by Don Luis Campos of Cordillera de Fuego from trees of the Caturra and Catuaí varieties of Arabica, and processed by the “thermic” method, in which beans, with skins removed, are heated with some of the fruit flesh or mucilage still adhering to them. The exposure to heat starts to break down the natural sugars of the mucilage, partially caramelizing it.  Visit www.folklorecoffeemt.com for more information.
Bottom Line A Costa Rica coffee processed by an experimental method that results in an inviting cup evocative of baking spices.Explore Similar CoffeesClick here for more reviews from Folklore CoffeeClick here for more information about coffees from Costa Rica

Richly aromatic, deeply sweet. Dark chocolate, blackberry, honeysuckle, fresh-cut oak, lemon balm in aroma and cup. Sweet-toned structure with lively acidity; delicately satiny mouthfeel. Rich chocolate and fresh blackberry notes dominate in a flavor-saturated finish.
Notes
Bourbon Pointu, botanical name var. Laurina, is a natural mutation of the famous Bourbon variety, first selected on Reunion Island in the Indian Ocean. The Bourbon Pointu is famous for its natural low levels of caffeine, bean shape (small and tending to be pointed at the ends, hence “pointu”), and pungently fruit-toned, Bourbon-like cup. This version was produced in Kona and is a dry-processed or “natural” coffee, meaning the beans were dried inside the fruit. Hula Daddy is a boutique coffee producer with farms at the 1,400- and 2,500-foot levels of the Mount Hualalai volcano near the northern end of the Kona growing district, five minutes above the town of Kailua-Kona. This coffee was produced at the higher elevation Hula Daddy farm. Visit www.huladaddy.com or call 808-327-9744 for more information.
Bottom Line A harmoniously structured, berry-driven Kona Bourbon Pointu Laurina cup, nuanced, complex, rare. Explore Similar CoffeesClick here for more reviews from Hula Daddy Kona CoffeeClick here for more information about coffees from HawaiiVisit Hula Daddy Kona Coffee

Notes
Produced from trees of the rare Ethiopia-derived botanical variety Gesha (also Geisha) by Adam and Rachel Overton. With its generally elongated beans and distinctive floral and crisp, often chocolaty cup, the Gesha variety continues to distinguish itself as one of the world’s most unique coffees. Although the Gesha variety originated in Ethiopia, it was “discovered” by the coffee world in 2004 growing in Boquete, Panama, and Panama continues to dominate the expanding world of Gesha. This particular version, however, is the outcome of efforts to commercialize Gesha in the region from which it originally came. It is processed by the natural method (dried in the whole fruit).

Notes
Produced at Acacia Hills Coffee Estate entirely of the Geisha variety of Arabica, and processed by the washed method (fruit skin and flesh are removed from the beans before they are dried). This particular sample consists entirely of peaberries, a kind of bean that results when the coffee fruit develops only a single, oval bean rather than the usual pair of flat-sided beans. Paradise Roasters specializes in micro-lot Arabica and Robusta coffees from Asia and other emerging origins. Paradise prides itself on quality and freshness, craft-roasting coffees in small batches only after orders are placed. Visit www.paradiseroasters.com or call 763-433-0626 for more information.

A ready-to-drink black coffee, tested cold. Black cherry, cocoa nib, lilac, toffee, sassafras. Sweet-savory structure with juicy acidity; crisp, delicate mouthfeel. The savory-sweet theme continues into the finish with notes of lilac and sassafras. The volume is turned down in milk in exchange for a mellow, toffee-driven vibe.
Notes
The coffee tied for the second-highest rating in a tasting of ready-to-drink black coffees for Coffee Review’s July 2021 tasting report. Dripdash brewed and canned the coffee. The brewing was conducted using a cold brewing method in which ice-chilled water drips through a bed of ground coffee over the course of several hours per batch. Contains no additives or ingredients other than coffee and water. The coffee, sourced and roasted by Chromatic, is a blend of a natural-processed Brazil, a washed Ethiopia, and a washed Guatemala. Chromatic prides itself in doing everything in-house and meticulously, from printing its attractive bags to modifying equipment to sourcing and roasting its exceptional coffees. Visit www.chromaticcoffee.com for more information.
Bottom Line What would obviously be a friendly and inviting blend brewed hot is captured here in cold-coffee form: sweet-tart fruit notes juxtaposed with a cocoa and sweet-savory undercurrent.Explore Similar CoffeesClick here for more reviews from Chromatic x Dripdash Collab

A ready-to-drink black coffee, tested cold. Baking chocolate, hazelnut, rose hips, raspberry, cedar. Sweet-toned structure with citrusy acidity; pleasingly dry mouthfeel (think good dry vermouth). Resonant, long, flavor-saturated finish. Milk softens all the dramatic edges of this compelling blend, emphasizing a gentle sweet-tart creaminess.
Notes
The coffee tied for the second-highest rating in a tasting of ready-to-drink black coffees for Coffee Review’s July 2021 tasting report. Prepared by the cold-brew method, which involves prolonged steeping of ground coffee in cold or room-temperature water and subsequent filtering. Contains no additives or ingredients other than coffee and water. Infused with nitrogen when canned. The green coffee blend used is a natural-processed Ethiopia, a washed-process Ethiopia, and a natural-processed Brazil.

Blind Assessment
Evaluated at a steeping time of 6 minutes. This beverage is composed of coffee that has essentially been toasted but not roasted. Toasted grain, cocoa nib, hints of raw cashew and limelike citrus in aroma and cup. Sweet, woody/grainy structure with a hint of bitterness but no acidy sensation whatsoever. The mouthfeel is thin and tea-like but silky in texture. Grain and nut fade in the finish, though a woody sweetness lasts.
Notes
The Golden Ratio company aims at selling North America on a coffee produced by steeping plump bags of ground coffee that has essentially been toasted rather than roasted. Instructions accompanying these pouches suggest steeping the pouch 5 to 10 minutes to produce an 8-ounce beverage. We achieved what we considered optimal results (maximum aromatic interest) at around 6 minutes. The pouches also can be brewed at room temperature for a recommended 12 to 18 hours. For more information go to drinkgoldenratio.com.
Bottom Line Those who want caffeine and the health benefits of coffee without perceived acidity may value and enjoy this subtle, herbal-tea-like beverage. Think cocoa puffs breakfast cereal without the sugar.Explore Similar CoffeesClick here for more reviews from Golden RatioClick here for more information about coffees from Ethiopia

Lyrically sweet, luxuriously chocolaty. Chocolate fudge, tamarind, sandalwood, narcissus, a hint of wine barrel in aroma and cup. Sweetly tart structure with vibrant, juicy acidity; plush, creamy mouthfeel. The finish resolves around chocolate fudge and tamarind with undertones of rich sandalwood.
Notes
This exceptional coffee was selected as the No. 5 coffee on Coffee Review’s list of the Top 30 Coffees of 2021. The coffee earned the highest rating in a cupping of coffees from roasters in North American beach and coastal communities for Coffee Review’s April 2021 report. Mocca (also spelled Moka and Mokka) is a rare variety of Arabica that apparently originated in the Reunion Islands as a mutant of the great Bourbon variety. This Mocca was processed by the natural method (dried in the whole fruit). This unusual coffee with its tiny beans and striking cup is available only on the Hula Daddy website through their allocation list. Hula Daddy is a boutique coffee producer with farms at the 1,400- and 2,500-foot levels of the Mount Hualalai volcano near the northern end of the Kona growing district, five minutes above the town of Kailua-Kona. This coffee was produced at the higher elevation Hula Daddy farm. Visit www.huladaddy.com or call 888-553-2339 for more information.
Bottom Line A decadent, dessert-like cup from the rare Mocca variety of Arabica with a throughline of tropical fruit and a hint of sweet ferment.Explore Similar CoffeesClick here for more reviews from Hula Daddy Kona CoffeeClick here for more information about coffees from HawaiiVisit Hula Daddy Kona Coffee

Balanced, deep-toned, floral. Honeysuckle, apricot, almond butter, dark chocolate, a hint of thyme in aroma and cup. Sweet structure with comfortable, straightforward acidity; plush, viscous mouthfeel. Floral-driven finish with undertones of dark chocolate and almond.
Notes
This coffee tied for the third-highest rating in a cupping of coffees from roasters in North American beach and coastal communities for Coffee Review’s April 2021 report. Produced at Kona Hills Farm entirely of the Typica variety of Arabica and processed by the washed method (fruit skin and flesh are removed from the beans before they are dried). Consists entirely of peaberries, a kind of bean that results when the coffee fruit develops only a single, oval bean rather than the usual pair of flat-sided beans.  Peaberries produce a somewhat different (often better) cup than normal beans from the same crop, from which they may or may not be separated during grading. Big Island Coffee is an award-winning coffee roaster operated with hands-on passion by Kelleigh Stewart and Brandon von Damitz. Visit www.bigislandcoffeeroasters.com for more information.
Bottom Line A classic Kona Typica cup produced by a new sustainability-minded farm. And nicely priced for a fine Kona.Explore Similar CoffeesClick here for more reviews from Big Island Coffee RoastersClick here for more information about coffees from HawaiiVisit Big Island Coffee Roasters

Delicately sweet, deeply fruit-toned. Goji berry, alyssum, almond brittle, marjoram, sandalwood in aroma and cup. Sweet structure with high-toned acidity; very full, viscous mouthfeel. Finish consolidates to notes of goji berry and almond brittle.
Notes
This coffee tied for the third-highest rating in a cupping of coffees from roasters in North American beach and coastal communities for Coffee Review’s April 2021 report. Bourbon Pointu, botanical name var. Laurina, is a natural mutation of the famous Bourbon variety, first selected on Reunion Island in the Indian Ocean. The Bourbon Pointu is famous for its natural low levels of caffeine, bean shape (small and tending to be pointed at the ends, hence “pointu”), and pungently fruit-toned, Bourbon-like cup. This version was grown in Kona and processed by the natural method (beans are dried in the whole fruit). Kraig and Leslie Lee have been growing and harvesting traditional Kona Coffee for over 25 years. In 2017 they introduced several distinguished new tree varieties to their 4.7 acre farm. Visit konafarmdirect.com for more information.

Blind Assessment
A splendid, uncompromising example of its style, though not for everyone. Fresh humus, perique pipe tobacco, freshly dried prune, musk, raw chocolate in aroma and cup. Sweet-savory structure with low-toned, round acidity; plush, syrupy mouthfeel. The sweetly earth-toned finish is long and resonant, with notes of forest floor, pipe tobacco and musk.
Notes
Produced by smallholding farmers from trees of the Linie S, Typica and Kartika varieties of Arabica and processed by the traditional Sumatra wet-hulled method, then deliberately held in an aging warehouse for five years. Paradise Roasters specializes in micro-lot Arabica and Robusta coffees from Asia and other emerging origins. The company prides itself on quality and freshness, craft-roasting coffees in small batches only after orders are placed. Visit www.paradiseroasters.com or call 763-433-0626 for more information.
Bottom Line Paradise says, “This coffee reminds us of Paul Bunyan chopping his way through a great forest, wearing Old Spice cologne, smoking a cigar, and not giving a care.” In more explicit terms, this coffee is earthy, foresty, musky and fresh tobacco-toned.Explore Similar CoffeesClick here for more reviews from Paradise RoastersClick here for more information about coffees from SumatraVisit Paradise Roasters

Produced at Daterra Estate entirely from coffee of the Aramosa pre-cultivar, a cross between the Coffea arabica species and the small-beaned Coffea racemosa species from South Africa. This crossbreeding was aimed at combining Racemosa’s low caffeine and drought-resistance with Arabica’s flavor. (Aramosa is a pre-cultivar still under development and study.) Processed by the anaerobic honey method (coffee fruit with skins removed but mucilage intact is subject to reduced oxygen ferment before drying).

The company prides itself on quality and freshness, craft-roasting coffees in small batches only after orders are placed. Visit www.paradiseroasters.com or call 763-433-0626 for more information.

Southern Ethiopia coffees like this one are largely produced from traditional Ethiopian varieties of Arabica long grown in the region.

Notes
This exceptional coffee was selected as the No. 9 coffee on Coffee Review’s list of the Top 30 Coffees of 2021. Coffees from the northern part of the Indonesian island of Sumatra are valued for their complex earth and fruit notes that appear to result largely from unorthodox fruit removal and drying practices called “wet-hulling.” This is a particularly refined example of the type. GK Coffee is a nano-roastery in Yilan, Taiwan that offers both retail and wholesale coffee. For more information, visit www.gkcoffee.com.tw or email [email protected].

Sweetly savory, complex. Pipe tobacco, date, narcissus, almond, baking chocolate in aroma and cup. Sweet-toned with lively acidity; very full, creamy mouthfeel. The finish centers on notes of date and pipe tobacco.

Delicately sweet-savory, floral-toned. Lilac, plum, almond brittle, lemon verbena, gently scorched elm in aroma and cup. RIchly bittersweet structure with gentle acidity; syrupy-smooth mouthfeel. The finish centers around notes of lemon verbena and lightly scorched elm.

SL34 is a tree variety famously associated with the fine coffees of Kenya; this version was grown in Kona. After the coffee fruit is pulped, it is processed with a yeast-ferment step (with no additional water being added to the tank) prior to being washed. Kraig and Leslie Lee have been growing and harvesting traditional Kona Coffee for over 25 years. In 2017 they introduced several distinguished new tree varieties to their 4.7 acre farm, including this one, which they are offering for the first time. Visit konafarmdirect.com for more information.

Bourbon Pointu, botanical name var. Laurina, is a natural mutation of the famous Bourbon variety, first selected on Reunion Island in the Indian Ocean. The Bourbon Pointu is famous for its natural low levels of caffeine, bean shape (small and tending to be pointed at the ends, hence “pointu”), and pungently fruit-toned, Bourbon-like cup. This version was grown in Kona and processed by the anaerobic natural fermentation method. Kraig and Leslie Lee have been growing and harvesting traditional Kona Coffee for over 25 years.

Notes
This sample consists entirely of peaberries, a kind of bean that results when the coffee fruit develops only a single, oval bean rather than the usual pair of flat-sided beans. Peaberries produce a somewhat different (often better) cup than normal beans from the same crop, from which they may or may not be separated during grading.

Notes
Yirgacheffe is a coffee region in southern Ethiopia that produces distinctive coffees from indigenous varieties of landrace Arabica long grown in the region. This is a “natural” or dry-processed version, meaning the beans were dried inside the fruit, encouraging a flavor profile that is rounder and lower-toned than the more familiar wet-processed floral- and citrus-toned Yirgacheffe profile.

This exceptional coffee was selected as the No. 4 coffee on Coffee Review’s list of the Top 30 Coffees of 2020. Produced at Finca Sophia entirely from trees of the celebrated Geisha variety of Arabica. This is a wet-processed or “washed” version (fruit skin and pulp are removed before drying). This coffee was produced on the same farm under the same conditions as the lot that won the 2020 Best of Panama competition in the washed Geisha category (which famously sold at auction for a record-breaking $1,300.50 per pound) but it is not from the actual record-breaking lot.

Notes
This exceptional coffee was selected as the No. 6 coffee on Coffee Review’s list of the Top 30 Coffees of 2020. Mocca (also spelled Moka and Mokka) is a rare and famous variety of Arabica that reached Kaanapali, Hawaii from Brazil. Current thinking in the technical coffee community is that it originated in the Reunion Islands as a mutant of the great Bourbon variety, although it closely resembles a variety long grown in Yemen called Ismaili. This Mocca was processed by the natural method (dried in the whole fruit). This rare coffee with its tiny beans and striking cup is available only on the Hula Daddy website through their allocation list. Hula Daddy is a boutique coffee producer with farms at the 1,400- and 2,500-foot levels of the Mount Hualalai volcano near the northern end of the Kona growing district, five minutes above the town of Kailua-Kona. This coffee was produced at the higher elevation Hula Daddy farm. Visit www.huladaddy.com or call 888-553-2339 for more information.

Berry-driven, chocolaty. Blueberry, lemon zest, baking chocolate, cedar, a hint of fine musk in aroma and cup. Sweet-savory structure with quietly resonant acidity; syrupy, gently lively mouthfeel. Flavor consolidates to blueberry and cedar in the short finish but both linger far into the long.
Notes
Southern Ethiopia coffees like this one are largely produced from distinctive indigenous Ethiopian varieties of Arabica long grown in their respective regions. This is a dry-processed or “natural” version, meaning the beans were dried inside the fruit rather than after the fruit has been removed, as is the case with wet-processed or “washed” coffees. Pro Aroma Enterprise Coffee Co., Ltd. is a Taiwan-based specialty coffee company. For more information, visit proaroma.weebly.com or email [email protected].
Bottom Line A fusion of fruit (blueberry) and savory (fine musk) drive the cup, punctuated by citrusy brightness.Explore Similar CoffeesClick here for more reviews from Pro Aroma Enterprise CoffeeClick here for more information about coffees from EthiopiaVisit Pro Aroma Enterprise Coffee

Evaluated as espresso. Bright, juicy, sweetly tart. Pomegranate, hazelnut, cedar, freesia-like flowers, molasses in aroma and small cup. Syrupy-smooth mouthfeel; crisp, gently drying finish. Rounder and more nut-toned in three parts milk.
Notes
Southern Ethiopia coffees like this one are largely produced from distinctive indigenous Ethiopian varieties of Arabica long grown in their respective regions. This is a dry-processed or “natural” version, meaning the beans were dried inside the fruit rather than after the fruit has been removed, as is the case with wet-processed or “washed” coffees. Bona Kafo is a Taiwan-based specialty coffee roaster. Visit www.bonakaforoastery.com.
Bottom Line A tale of two coffees: The straight shot is bracingly tart-leaning, while the milk shot is gentler and more nut-toned. Both display attractive aspects of this natural-processed single-origin espresso.Explore Similar CoffeesClick here for more reviews from Bona Kafo RoasteryClick here for more information about coffees from Ethiopia

Bright, sweetly spice-toned. Cinnamon, candy apple, grapefruit zest, freesia-like flowers, a hint of fresh yogurt in aroma and cup. Sweet-tart structure with lively, high-toned acidity; crisp, satiny mouthfeel. The finish continues spice-toned and rich.
Notes
Produced by Don Luis Campos of Cordillera del Fuego and processed by the “thermic” method, in which beans, with skins removed, are heated with some of the fruit flesh or mucilage still adhering to them. The exposure to heat starts to break down the natural sugars of the mucilage, partially caramelizing it. This coffee was imported by Genuine Origin, a specialty-focused coffee importer based in Irvington, New York. Collage Coffee is a micro-roastery featuring specialty coffee and house brewed kombucha. Colläge works with local artists to promote fine arts in its region, and loves serving its community. This coffee is available for purchase at the Collage store and cafe, 221 South Broad Street, Grove City, Pennsylvania.

Produced by Oscar and Francisca Chacon entirely from trees of the Caturra variety of Arabica; certified organically grown.

Notes
Coffees from the northern part of the Indonesian island of Sumatra are valued for their complex earth and fruit notes that appear to result largely from unorthodox fruit removal and drying practices called “wet-hulling.” This is a particularly refined example of the type, produced in the Lintong region south of Lake Toba, one of the oldest and arguably the most admired of Sumatra growing regions.

Deeply sweet, cocoa-toned. Dark chocolate, dried persimmon, hazelnut, wisteria, maple syrup in aroma and cup. Balanced, brisk but sweet structure with rounded acidity; satiny-smooth mouthfeel. The finish is thoroughly chocolaty with undertones of persimmon and hazelnut.
Notes
Southern Ethiopia coffees like this one are largely produced from distinctive indigenous Ethiopian varieties of Arabica long grown in their respective regions. This is a dry-processed or “natural” version, meaning the beans were dried inside the fruit rather than after the fruit has been removed, as is the case with wet-processed or “washed” coffees. Dory Coffee Roasters is a Taipei-based nano-roaster of specialty coffee. For more information, visit https://www.facebook.com/dorycoffee99/.

This coffee earned the fifth-highest rating in a cupping of coffees roasted by Black-owned coffee companies for Coffee Review’s August 2020 report. Coffee trees were brought to Haiti in 1715 when the country was colonized by the French. Farmed by enslaved people, most crops were destroyed in the Haitian revolution of 1791.

Richly sweet, deeply aromatic, vibrant. Dried apricot, dark chocolate, narcissus, pink grapefruit zest, sandalwood in aroma and cup. Sweet-tart structure with lively, balanced acidity; full, creamy mouthfeel. A quiet finish centers around chocolate and apricot notes supported by sandalwood.
Notes
This coffee comes from four growing regions in Yemen: Hajja, Haraz, Beni Ismael and Beni Matar. Although Ethiopia is the botanical home of Coffea Arabica, Yemen introduced the beverage to the rest of the world in the 16th and 17th centuries, and Yemen coffee is still grown from ancient cultivars of arabica on stone-walled terraces. All Yemen coffees are natural-processed, or dried in the whole fruit. This particular Yemen may owe its striking aromatics to ancient tree varieties, but its clean elegance is most likely owing to the efforts of exporter Rayyan Mill in the capital of Sana’a, which has worked with farmers to improve picturesque but often haphazard harvesting and drying procedures. Baba Java is a specialty roaster and cafe retailer located in Hoover Alabama that strives to provide the best coffee experience at every step. Visit www.babajavacoffee.com or call 205-777-5984 for more information. 
Bottom Line A lovely introduction to the pleasures of Yemen: fruit-toned yet balanced, floral yet restrained, and mysterious with its throughline of deep aromatic wood that is more perfumy than earthy.Explore Similar CoffeesClick here for more reviews from Baba Java CoffeeClick here for more information about coffees from Yemen

Blind Assessment
A ready-to-drink black coffee, tested cold. Deeply sweet, caramel-toned. Dark caramel, vanilla bean, date, magnolia, fresh-cut oak. Richly sweet in structure with lively acidity; lightly velvety mouthfeel. Consolidates to dark caramel and vanilla bean in the finish. Milk gives this cold coffee a dessert-like quality.
Notes
This coffee tied for the second-highest rating in a tasting of ready-to-drink black coffees for Coffee Review’s July 2020 tasting report. Certified organic. Prepared by the cold-brew method, which involves prolonged steeping of ground coffee in cold or room-temperature water and subsequent filtering. Contains no additives or ingredients other than coffee and water. The green coffee used to produce this particular Stumptown product is a single-origin Ethiopia Guji. Stumptown Coffee is a small-batch premium roasting company that wholesales its coffees as well as serves them in its cafes in five U.S. cities, including its latest expansion to New Orleans. Visit www.stumptowncoffee.com or call 855-711-3385 for more information.
Bottom Line Deep, rich, as sweet as can be, developed in the roast to bring out caramel notes while retaining fruit and floral tones.Explore Similar CoffeesClick here for more reviews from Stumptown Coffee RoastersClick here for more information about coffees from Ethiopia

A ready-to-drink black coffee, tested cold. Crisp, sweetly tart, multi-layered. Black cherry, rhododendron, marzipan, oak, baking chocolate. Sweet-tart structure with brisk acidity; full, syrupy mouthfeel. Marzipan and oak carry into the quietly engaging finish. Milk changes the equation entirely; rhododendron and baking chocolate take center stage with levity added by the infused nitrogen.
Notes
This coffee tied for the second-highest rating in a tasting of ready-to-drink black coffees for Coffee Review’s July 2020 tasting report.

Topéca Coffee is an artisan roaster with three café locations and a roastery in Tulsa, Oklahoma.Visit www.topecacoffee.com or call 918-398-8022 for more information.
Bottom Line A balanced, approachably complex nitro cold brew made from Topéca’s longstanding Porch Session Blend. Be forewarned: owing to a very high coffee-to-water brewing ration, one 8.4-ounce can contains as much caffeine as a 20-ounce cup of hot-brewed coffee!Explore Similar CoffeesClick here for more reviews from Topeca Coffee

A ready-to-drink black coffee, tested cold. Bing cherry, sassafras, aromatic orchid, bay tree, brandy. Sweet-tart structure with juicy, bright acidity; lush, mouth-filling viscosity. Long, resonant, flavor-saturated finish that carries over all the notes from the cup. Quiet and elegant in milk, with all flavor notes represented at a lower volume.
Notes
This coffee tied for the highest rating in a tasting of ready-to-drink black coffees for Coffee Review’s July 2020 tasting report. Prepared by the cold-brew method, which involves prolonged steeping of ground coffee in cold or room-temperature water and subsequent filtering. Contains no additives or ingredients other than coffee and water. The green coffee used is a washed Brazil Ipanema that was processed in an atypical way, including a 34-hour pre-drying period on patio, followed by 44 hours in vertical driers before storage in double-barrier bags, at which point the roaster surmises that fermentation continues, resulting in a winy aroma and flavor more often associated with natural-processed coffees. The roaster sells this coffee as whole bean for NT $500/200 grams. GK Coffee is a nano-roastery in Yilan, Taiwan that offers both retail and wholesale coffee. For more information, visit www.gkcoffee.com.tw or email [email protected].
Bottom Line Tasted blind, this reads like a natural-processed coffee, but it is fully washed with an unusual, and very appealing sweet ferment, suggesting cherry liqueur. Delicious with a side of high-quality dark chocolate.Explore Similar CoffeesClick here for more reviews from GK CoffeeClick here for more information about coffees from BrazilVisit GK Coffee

Very sweet; floral and yogurt-like. Pineapple kefir, dark chocolate, cashew, tiger lily, kumquat in aroma and cup. Completely original structure: quite sweet, with a delicately tart character associated with lactic acid fermentation. Lively, crisply round mouthfeel. Richly intricate, layered, flavored-saturated finish.
Notes
Produced by Gonzalo Hernandez at his Coffea Diversa “coffee garden” in Costa Rica entirely of the Deweverei variety of coffea Liberica. Liberica is a species of coffee native to central Africa and long cultivated in parts of Southeast Asia. Processed by the carbonic maceration natural method, which involves fermenting whole fruit inside a sealed container that has been flushed with CO2. Paradise Roasters specializes in micro-lot Arabica and Robusta coffees from Asia and other emerging origins. The company prides itself on quality and freshness, craft-roasting coffees in small batches only after orders are placed. Visit www.paradiseroasters.com or call 763-433-0626 for more information.
Bottom Line An exceedingly rare coffee in all respects: A genuinely fine coffee produced from trees of the overlooked and poorly regarded Liberica species, processed by the still unusual carbonic maceration method.

Deep, intense, sweet-savory, utterly coherent. Intense lavender, black currant, mandarin orange, sandalwood, dark chocolate in aroma and cup. Sweet, tart, savory-bottomed structure with intense, balanced acidity; big, mouth-filling body. The flavor-saturated finish carries over every nuance from the cup.
Notes
This exceptional coffee was selected as the No. 17 coffee on Coffee Review’s list of the Top 30 Coffees of 2020.  The coffee tied for the highest rating in a cupping of “desert-island coffees” submitted by roasters for Coffee Review’s May 2020 tasting report. This version of the ancient Mocha-Java blend combines a traditionally processed, wet-hulled Sumatra in place of the original Java and replaces the Yemen Mocha with a similar “natural” or dried-in-the-fruit coffee from Ethiopia. One of the country’s pioneering socially and environmentally progressive roasters, Thanksgiving aimed to combine coffee quality with social and environmental responsibility many years before the latter preoccupations became fashionable. Visit www.thanksgivingcoffee.com or call 800-648-6491 for more information.

Notes
This coffee tied for the fourth-highest rating in a cupping of “desert-island coffees” submitted by roasters for Coffee Review’s May 2020 tasting report. Coffees from the northern part of the Indonesian island of Sumatra are valued for their complex earth and fruit notes that appear to result largely from unorthodox fruit removal and drying practices called “wet-hulling.” This is a particularly refined example of the type. Cloud City Coffee is a specialty roaster and coffee shop founded in 2002 by roaster Jill Killen.

Blind Assessment
Evaluated as espresso. Sweet, odd, earth-toned. Caramel, orange, pecan, a hint of dark chocolate and a lot of fruit-scented earth--think fallen oranges in a citrus grove--in aroma and small cup. Fluffy mouthfeel. Chocolate comes forward in a sweet though drying finish. Three parts milk further develops the chocolate, while the earth notes persist, particularly in the finish. 
Notes
This coffee was processed by the washed method (fruit skin and pulp removed before drying), then aged for three years in its parchment skins before hulling and shipping. Telluride is an artisan roaster situated at high elevations in Colorado offering an attractive range of single-origins and blends. Visit www.telluridecoffeeroasters.net for more information.
Bottom Line The sweet, fruit-on-the-edge of decay character central to this curious aged espresso may please those espresso drinkers who value surprise, while probably offending coffee purists.

Deeply and sweetly pungent; layered and intricate. Dark chocolate, raspberry, freesia, port wine, a hint of fresh, fragrant tobacco in aroma and cup. Balanced, quietly forceful in its sweet-savory structure; light but exceptionally silky in mouthfeel. All notes ring on in a layered, flavor-saturated finish.
Notes
Bourbon Pointu, botanical name var. Laurina, is a natural mutation of the famous Bourbon variety, first selected on Reunion Island in the Indian Ocean. The Bourbon Pointu is famous for its natural low levels of caffeine, bean shape (small and tending to be pointed at the ends, hence “pointu”), and pungently fruit-toned, Bourbon-like cup. This version was produced in Kona and is a dry-processed or “natural” coffee, meaning the beans were dried inside the fruit. Hula Daddy is a boutique coffee producer with farms at the 1,400 and 2,500 foot levels of the Mount Hualalai volcano near the northern end of the Kona growing district, five minutes above the town of Kailua-Kona. This rare coffee is only available on the Hula Daddy website through their allocation list. Visit www.huladaddy.com or call 888-553-2339 for more information.

This lot was processed by the wet or washed method (fruit skin and pulp are removed before drying). JBC Coffee Roasters’ vision is simple: “let the coffee lead the way” through sourcing and roasting the best and most unique coffees available and rewarding the farmers who grow those coffees with substantial premiums. Visit www.jbccoffeeroasters.com or call 608-256-5282 for more information.

Evaluated as espresso. Bright, sweetly tart, high-toned. Black cherry, chocolate fudge, almond butter, freesia-like flowers, sandalwood in aroma and small cup. Crisp, satiny mouthfeel; resonant fruit-toned finish. Particularly floral-saturated in three parts milk, with dark chocolate and cherry undertones.

Produced by Mekuriya Gobena in the Yirgacheffe growing region of Ethiopia on his 12-acre farm.

The company prides itself on quality and freshness, craft-roasting coffees in small batches only after orders are placed. Visit www.paradiseroasters.com or call 763-433-0626 for more information.

Round, sweet, complex, original. Magnolia, musk, lemon verbena, maple syrup, complex fruit (peach, jackfruit) in aroma and cup. Balanced, sweetly low-toned in structure; buoyant and satiny in mouthfeel. Rich, round, pungently layered finish: peach, magnolia. 
Notes
This coffee is sold only as a part of the Paradise Roasters Rare Coffees Tour subscription series. Eugenioides is a species of coffee that botanists believe spontaneously crossed with Robusta to create the Arabica species 10,000 to 25,000 years ago. Over the last few years some farms have experimented with producing small volumes of pure Eugenioides. Marked by great sweetness coupled with often savory-leaning complexity, Eugenioides can produce an original and striking cup. This is a dry-processed or “natural” version, meaning the beans were dried inside the fruit rather than after the fruit has been removed, as is the case with wet-processed or “washed” coffees. Paradise Roasters specializes in micro-lot Arabica and Robusta coffees from Asia and other emerging origins. The company prides itself on quality and freshness, craft-roasting coffees in small batches only after orders are placed. Visit www.paradiseroasters.com or call 763-433-0626 for more information.

Sweet-tart structure with crisp, bright acidity; vibrantly plush, syrupy mouthfeel. The resonant finish centers around guava and jasmine notes with undertones of cocoa nib.
Notes
This coffee from the Puna District of Hawaii, comprised of the Typica and Caturra varieties of Arabica, was processed using an unusual sequence of procedures. It was first fermented in the whole fruit with wine yeasts added to the tank, then dried in the whole fruit, making it, in effect, a fermented natural. Paradise Roasters specializes in micro-lot Arabica and Robusta coffees from Asia and other emerging origins. The company prides itself on quality and freshness, craft-roasting coffees in small batches only after orders are placed. Visit www.paradiseroasters.com or call 763-433-0626 for more information. 
Bottom Line A fruit- and floral-toned coffee from a lesser-known growing region on the Big Island of Hawai’i is worth seeking out for its balanced completeness and its suggestions of the tropics, both aromatically and in the cup.Explore Similar CoffeesClick here for more reviews from Paradise RoastersClick here for more information about coffees from HawaiiVisit Paradise Roasters

Comprised of three coffees: a washed-process Kenya Kijani Kiboko AA and two natural-processed coffees, an Ethiopia Dame Dabaye and a Brazil Fazenda Serrinha. Modern Times is a well-loved, exuberantly inventive Point Loma, San Diego brewery that has long specialized in coffee-beer crossovers and overlaps. Visit www.moderntimescoffee.com for more information.
Bottom Line This coffee’s name is loosely drawn from the name of the winter solstice celebration for Mithraism, ""Natalis Solis Invincti,"" which means “birthday of the unconquerable sun.” Drink it if for no other reason than this.Explore Similar CoffeesClick here for more reviews from Modern Times Coffee

Blind Assessment
Very roast-prominent, chocolaty and spiced-toned. Chocolate, charred mesquite, date, baking spices, dark caramel in aroma and cup. Sweet-toned structure with a bitter edge; full though drying mouthfeel. The finish, while sweet, is dominated by burned wood notes that obscure the underlying chocolate and fruit.
Notes
This blend was purchased from a Peet’s Coffee retail location as a nationally branded benchmark comparison for the holiday blends from other smaller roasters reviewed this month. It is comprised of three coffees: a wet-hulled Sumatra Batak, a washed-process Panama Finca Don Bosco, and a washed-process Kenya. Peet’s Coffee, now a national chain, was founded by Alfred Peet in 1966, making it one of the first and most influential artisan coffee roasters in the U.S. Visit www.peets.com for more information.
Bottom Line An interesting blend skillfully dark-roasted, save for the bitter, burned finish. Otherwise, quietly intriguing, sweet and smoky.Explore Similar CoffeesClick here for more reviews from Peet's Coffee

Deeply and richly sweet, resonantly juicy. Red currant, lavender, dark chocolate, sandalwood, fine musk in aroma and cup. Sweet-savory structure with vibrant, lively acidity; plush, syrupy mouthfeel. Both the aromatics and poised structure carry far into the finish with finesse and persistence. 
Notes
Processed by a particularly meticulous Kenya variation on the traditional wet or “washed” method, in which skin and fruit flesh are removed from the beans or seeds before they are dried. This sample consists entirely of peaberries, a kind of bean that results when the coffee fruit develops only a single, oval bean rather than the usual pair of flat-sided beans. Peaberries produce a somewhat different (often better) cup than normal beans from the same crop, from which they may or may not be separated during grading. Quartet Kaffe is an artisan roastery in Taiwan founded in 2018, dedicated to pursuing coffee performance art and offering unique speciality coffee.

Notes
Coffees from the Yirgacheffe region are produced from distinctive, largely indigenous Ethiopian varieties of Arabica long grown in the region. This is a “natural” or dry-processed version, meaning the beans were dried inside the fruit, encouraging a cup profile that is sweeter and deeper-toned than perhaps more familiar wet-processed Yirgacheffe profile.

Notes
Coffees like this one from the northern part of the Indonesian island of Sumatra are valued for their complex earth and fruit notes that appear to result largely from unorthodox fruit removal and drying practices called “wet hulling.” Kakalove Café is a nano-roaster located in the small city of Chia-Yi in Taiwan that strives to procure and roast the finest quality coffee.

Bottom Line An intense and gratifying Sumatran coffee, offering the qualities that make Sumatra an exciting origin for many coffee lovers (earth/tobacco, cocoa, sweetness, citrus) without the overly pungent earthy characteristics that often shadow this origin.

Delicate, berry-toned, deeply sweet. Wild strawberry, honey, freesia-like flowers, oak, almond paste in aroma and cup. Sweetly tart structure with juicy, high-toned acidity; lively, silky mouthfeel. Resonant, flavor-saturated finish sustains all of the notes from the cup, wild strawberry and almond in particular.
Notes
Coffees from the Yirgacheffe region are produced from distinctive, largely indigenous Ethiopian varieties of Arabica long grown in the region. Like most southern Ethiopia coffees, this coffee is produced by villagers on small garden plots interplanted with food and other subsistence crops. This is a “natural” or dry-processed version, meaning the beans were dried inside the fruit, encouraging a flavor profile that is sweeter and deeper-toned than the more familiar wet-processed profile. Kakalove Café is a nano-roaster located in the small city of Chia-Yi in Taiwan that strives to procure and roast the finest quality coffee. Visit www.kakalovecafe.com.tw or email [email protected] for more information.
Bottom Line An exceptionally purely expressed natural-processed Yirgacheffe cup, berry- and nut-driven, supported by spicy floral notes throughout.Explore Similar CoffeesClick here for more reviews from Kakalove CafeClick here for more information about coffees from EthiopiaVisit Kakalove Cafe

Deeply sweet, complex, vibrantly rich. Dark chocolate, deep fruit notes (guava, raspberry jam, pineapple), aromatic orchid, frankincense, cedar-toned tobacco in aroma and cup. The acidity, while not bright, is enveloped in an elaborate and balanced structure with deep composure; mouthfeel is full and very syrupy. The short finish is chocolaty and sweet, with floral hints and a fine tobacco note resonating through to the long.
Notes
This exceptional coffee was selected as the No. 8 coffee on Coffee Review’s list of the Top 30 Coffees of 2019. Although Ethiopia is the botanical home of Coffea Arabica, Yemen introduced the beverage to the rest of the world in the 16th and 17th centuries, and Yemen coffee is still grown from ancient heirloom cultivars of Arabica on stone-walled terraces ringing fortress-like mountaintop villages. All Yemen coffees are natural-processed, or dried in the whole fruit. This particular Yemen was produced by smallholding farmers in the village of Al Hayma and processed by exporter Port of Mokha, which has worked closely with farmers to improve harvesting and drying procedures. Plat Coffee is a specialty roaster and café in Hong Kong. For more information, visit www.platcoffee.com.
Bottom Line An immense, engaging coffee: classically Yemen with cocoa, fruit and tobacco and a deep, quiet elegance. Explore Similar CoffeesClick here for more reviews from Plat Coffee RoasteryClick here for more information about coffees from Yemen

Evaluated as espresso. Attractively roast-prominent, deeply sweet and complex. Scorched cedar, baking chocolate, blackberry jam, blood orange zest, marjoram, violet-like flowers in aroma and small cup. Lightly creamy, almost fluffy mouthfeel. Finish consolidates around an herb-toned chocolate enveloped in a smoky resonance. In three parts milk, intensely sweet and aromatically vibrant, supported by a rich, smoky depth.
Notes
This exceptional coffee was selected as the No. 4 coffee on Coffee Review’s list of the Top 30 Coffees of 2019. Produced entirely from trees of the SL-28 variety of Arabica, the variety associated with the finest Kenya coffees. Processed by the yellow honey method. With all honey processing methods, some sweet pulp or fruit flesh (“honey”) is allowed to adhere to the beans during drying. In the yellow honey variation, a thin layer of pulp is allowed to dry on the beans, more than with white honey, but much less than is the case with red or black honey. In addition to his retail roasting operation, Aroma Roast Coffees, Simon Hsieh also operates Soaring Phoenix Trading, a business focused on purpose-built commercial espresso blends and high quality single-origin coffees.

Blind Assessment
Evaluated as espresso. Charred oak, baking chocolate, calla lily, browned butter and black cherry in aroma and small cup. Crisp, lightly velvety mouthfeel; the finish consolidates to cocoa-toned black cherry. In three parts milk, calla lily-like flowers and baking chocolate are amplified, while black cherry notes resurface in the long finish.
Notes
Southern Ethiopia coffees like this one are largely produced from indigenous Ethiopian varieties of Arabica long grown in the region. This is a “natural” or dry-processed version, meaning the beans were dried inside the fruit rather than after the fruit has been removed, as is the case with wet-processed or “washed” coffees.

Delicate, intricately sweet, vibrant  and impeccably balanced. Rose, crisp fruit (green apple, Bing cherry, wild strawberry), honey, tangerine zest, dragonwell green tea, fresh juniper in aroma and cup. The structure is incredibly sweet and juicy, yet zesty and richly tart. Light, but very silky mouthfeel. Flavor consolidates in the finish with a delicately crisp, sweet resonance.
Notes
This coffee won second place in the 2019 Best of Panama green coffee competition. Coffee from trees of the botanical variety Geisha (also Gesha) grown on Hacienda La Esmeralda in Panama first introduced this extraordinary variety of Arabica to the world. With its bold, boat-shaped beans and distinctive floral and crisply cocoa-toned cup, the Geisha/Gesha continues to be one of the world’s most celebrated and sought-after coffee varieties, and the Esmeralda versions remain among the most authentic. This is a wet-processed or “washed” version, meaning the fruit skin and pulp were removed from the beans immediately after harvesting but before drying. Boulder, Colorado-based Dragonfly Coffee was named 2019 Micro-Roaster of the Year by Roast magazine. Visit www.dragonflycoffeeroasters.com or call 303-579-2154 for more information.

Bizarre, beautiful, shocking, intricate. Tropical fruit (lychee, passionfruit), sweet herb (clove, cilantro, dill, spearmint), dark chocolate, musk, yogurt. In structure quite sweet, roundly tart (think unsweetened yogurt), deeply savory. Lightly syrupy in mouthfeel. Passionfruit, chocolate, dill all make distinct appearances in the drying but sweetly and richly complex finish.
Notes
This exceptional coffee was selected as the No. 10 coffee on Coffee Review’s list of the Top 30 Coffees of 2019. This coffee also earned the highest rating in a cupping of coffees produced using reduced oxygen (“anaerobic”) processing methods for Coffee Review’s November 2019 tasting report. The intensity and complexity of this extraordinary coffee are owing both to tree variety and processing method. The variety is the rare Ethiopia-derived botanical variety Geisha (also spelled Gesha). Joseph Brodsky and his colleagues processed this Geisha at Ninety Plus Gesha Estates in Panama using a refined and innovative processing procedure involving fermenting the whole, freshly-picked coffee fruit at high temperatures using a special yeast strain before drying it, still in the whole fruit. Willoughby’s Coffee & Tea is a pioneer specialty coffee roaster established in the early 1980s that has gracefully and successfully moved with the  times and now offers a menu of extremely refined small-lot, single-origin coffees. Visit www.willoughbyscoffee.com or call 800-388-8400 for more information.
Bottom Line A lush, juicy, tropical natural-processed profile overlaid on a deep, spicy/savory profile with something else as well, an edge we might associate with fermented foods like yogurt or pickles. Clearly for coffee adventurers.

Notes
This coffee tied for second-highest rating in a cupping of coffees produced using reduced oxygen (“anaerobic”) processing methods for Coffee Review’s November 2019 tasting report. Anaerobic processing, in this case, means that producer Luis Eduardo Campos fermented this coffee, after pulping or skinning, in a sealed, limited-oxygen stainless steel tank to encourage production of lactic acids that contribute to this sample’s very original cup profile.

This coffee tied for second-highest rating in a cupping of coffees produced using reduced oxygen (“anaerobic”) processing methods for Coffee Review’s November 2019 tasting report.

Notes
This coffee tied for third-highest rating in a cupping of coffees produced using reduced oxygen (“Anaerobic”) processing methods for Coffee Review’s November 2019 tasting report. Anaerobic processing in this case means this coffee went through “double” or two-stage fermentation in a sealed oxygen-evacuated tank, first in the whole fruit for two days, then after removal of skin and fruit pulp, for two more days.

Richly sweet-savory, spice- and floral-toned. Black cherry, tangerine zest, gardenia, marjoram, a hint of bay leaf in aroma and cup. In structure, sweet-tart and juicy with a savory depth. Syrupy and plush in mouthfeel; spicy flowers lead in a quietly flavor-saturated finish.    
Notes
Processed by a variation on the traditional washed process (fruit removed from the beans before drying) that adds no water to the tank during fermentation, hence a “dry” ferment. Southern Ethiopia coffees like this one are largely produced from distinctive indigenous varieties of Arabica long grown in the region. Coffeebar is a radically inclusive Italian café experience based in Truckee, California with locations in Menlo Park, Squaw Valley and Redwood City, as well as a roastery in Reno, Nevada. While it was founded in 2010, Coffeebar only began roasting in-house in 2018. Visit https://www.coffeebar.com/ for more information.

Vast yet intimate in its layered intricacy: complete and perfectly balanced.

Deeply sweet-tart structure with high-toned, juicy acidity; lush, syrupy mouthfeel. Resounding flavor-saturated finish with layer after layer of fruit far into the long. 
Notes
This exceptional coffee was selected as the No. 13 coffee on Coffee Review’s list of the Top 30 Coffees of 2019. Coffee from trees of the botanical variety Geisha (also Gesha) grown on Hacienda La Esmeralda in Panama first introduced this extraordinary variety of Arabica to the world. With its bold, boat-shaped beans and distinctive floral and crisply cocoa-toned cup, the Geisha/Gesha continues to be one of the world’s most celebrated and sought-after coffee varieties, and the Esmeralda versions remain among the most authentic. This is a “natural” or dry-processed version, meaning the beans were dried inside the fruit, encouraging a flavor profile that is sweeter and deeper-toned than typical wet-processed profiles. Campos Coffee is committed to sourcing the finest coffees, with a focus on ethical and sustainable practices. Campos has locations in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland, as well as Park City and Salt Lake City, Utah. For more information, visit camposcoffee.com.

High-toned, multi-layered, intriguingly complex. Wisteria, pineapple, myrrh, cocoa nib, pink grapefruit zest in aroma and cup. Richly sweet-tart structure with vibrant, juicy acidity; crisp yet syrupy mouthfeel. The resounding, flavor-laden finish is both deeply floral and richly sweet-tart.
Notes
Sold as part of a “Dynamic Duo Gesha Village” set that includes a 4-ounce tin of this “natural” Geisha and a 4-ounce tin of a “washed” version of the same coffee that earned 94-points in August 2019. The celebrated Geisha (also spelled Gesha) variety of Arabica first came to the coffee world’s attention growing in Panama. This particular version, however, is the outcome of efforts to commercialize Geisha in the region from which it originally came. It was grown in western Ethiopia by farmers Adam and Rachel Overton and their indigenous Meanit culture collaborators from seed selected from wild trees of the Geisha variety in the nearby Gori Gesha forest. This is a “natural” or dry-processed version, meaning the beans were dried inside the fruit, encouraging a flavor profile that is sweeter and deeper-toned than typical wet-processed profiles. JBC Coffee Roasters’ vision is simple: “let the coffee lead the way” through sourcing and roasting the best and most unique coffees available and rewarding the farmers who grow those coffees with substantial premiums.

 Nuanced, ethereal, yet exceptionally lush. Aprium, star jasmine, pistachio butter, cocoa, pink peppercorn, almond brittle in aroma and cup. High-toned, sweetly tart in structure with a juicy, vibrant acidity; levitating, nectar-like mouthfeel. The finish is rich-toned and resonant with all of the aromatics and flavors of the cup, star jasmine and cocoa, in particular. 

Notes
This coffee earned the highest rating in a cupping of coffees of the Geisha/Gesha variety of Arabica for Coffee Review’s September 2019 tasting report. Produced from the trees of the rare Ethiopia-derived botanical variety Geisha (also spelled Gesha) by the Lamastus family at Elida Estate. With its generally elongated beans and distinctive floral and crisp, often chocolaty cup, the Geisha/Gesha variety continues to distinguish itself as one of the world’s most unique coffees. The Green Tip strain is particularly admired. This is a “natural” or dry-processed version, meaning the beans were dried inside the fruit, encouraging a flavor profile that is sweeter and deeper-toned than the more familiar wet-processed profile. Willoughby’s Coffee & Tea is a pioneer specialty coffee roaster established in the early 1980s that has gracefully and successfully moved with the  times and now offers a menu of extremely refined small-lot, single-origin coffees.

This coffee earned the third-highest rating in a cupping of coffees of the Geisha/Gesha variety of Arabica for Coffee Review’s September 2019 tasting report. Coffee from trees of the botanical variety Geisha (also Gesha) grown on Hacienda La Esmeralda in Panama first introduced this extraordinary variety of Arabica to the world.

Crisply sweet-tart, fruit-toned. Blackberry jam, cocoa powder, almond, narcissus, baking spices in aroma and cup. Sweetly tart structure with bright, fruit-forward acdity; lively, satiny mouthfeel. The finish consolidates to notes of blackberry and cocoa.

Notes
This coffee tied for the fourth-highest rating in a cupping of coffees of the Geisha/Gesha variety of Arabica for Coffee Review’s September 2019 tasting report. Produced at Laderas del Tapias Estate entirely of the Geisha variety of Arabica. This is a dry-processed or “natural” version, meaning the beans were dried inside the fruit rather than after the soft fruit residue has been removed, as is the case with wet-processed or “washed” coffees. CafeTaster is a Taiwan-based specialty roaster and certified SCA training facility. For more information, visit www.facebook.com/cafetaster or email roaster Jerry Huang at [email protected].
Bottom Line A deep berry-toned cup with a juicy hint of sweet ferment and rich cocoa notes throughout.Explore Similar CoffeesClick here for more reviews from CafeTasterClick here for more information about coffees from Colombia

Rich, complex, very deeply sweet. Honey, lilac, guava, frankincense, cacao nib in aroma and cup. Richly sweet-tart structure with high-toned, juicy acidity; crisp, full, satiny mouthfeel. The rich-toned finish is both sweetly floral and invitingly tart.

Notes
This coffee tied for the fourth-highest rating in a cupping of coffees of the Geisha/Gesha variety of Arabica for Coffee Review’s September 2019 tasting report. The celebrated Geisha (also spelled Gesha) variety of Arabica first came to the coffee world’s attention growing in Panama. This particular version, however, is the outcome of efforts to commercialize Geisha in the region from which it originally came. It was grown in western Ethiopia by farmers Adam and Rachel Overton and their indigenous Meanit culture collaborators from seed selected from wild trees of the Geisha variety in the nearby Gori Gesha forest. This is a “natural” or dry-processed version, meaning the beans were dried inside the fruit, encouraging a flavor profile that is sweeter and deeper-toned than typical wet-processed profiles. GK Coffee provides quality specialty coffee to consumers and retailers. For more information, visit www.gkcoffee.com.tw or email [email protected].
Bottom Line A beautifully structured natural-processed Ethiopia Gesha, with striking sweetness pleasingly complicated by notes of aromatic resin and tropical fruit.Explore Similar CoffeesClick here for more reviews from GK CoffeeClick here for more information about coffees from EthiopiaVisit GK Coffee

Notes
This coffee earned the second-highest rating in a tasting of El Salvador coffees for Coffee Review’s August 2019 tasting report. Produced by Lucia Ortiz at Finca Las Mercedes from trees of the celebrated SL28 variety of Arabica, a Bourbon-related variety associated with Kenya’s finest coffees.

A deep sweetness and considerable complexity resonate impressively inside a bitter-savory structure. Hints of blueberry and guava, spearmint, cocoa, rose, a hint of clove in aroma and cup. Fully, syrupy mouthfeel. Flavor carries persuasively into a rich though bittersweet finish.
Notes
 This coffee tied for the fourth-highest rating in a tasting of El Salvador coffees for Coffee Review’s August 2019 tasting report. Produced from trees of the much admired, bold-bean Pacamara variety of Arabica, a cross between the giant-beaned Maragogipe variety and Pacas, a selection of the heirloom Bourbon, by José Flores at his farm El Trompillo. Processed by the natural method, meaning the beans were dried inside the fruit rather than after the fruit has been removed, as is the case with wet-processed or “washed” coffees.

Evaluated as espresso produced as a ristretto 25ml (.85-ounce) shot using a Nespresso capsule espresso brewer with whole milk heated using a conventional steam wand.

Subtly and sweetly intense: flowers and cocoa. Lavender, cocoa, honey, candied nut, lemon zest, much more in aroma and cup. Richly and sweetly pungent in structure; light though plush and satiny in mouthfeel. A quiet, layered finish consolidates around lemon and lavender. 
Notes
The celebrated Geisha (also spelled Gesha) variety of Arabica first came to the coffee world’s attention in Panama. This particular version, however, is the outcome of efforts to commercialize Gesha in the region from which it originally came. It was grown in western Ethiopia by farmers Adam and Rachel Overton and their indigenous Meanit culture collaborators from seed selected from wild trees of the Geisha variety in the nearby Gori Gesha forest. The Overtons auction their best lots every year; this lot was #11 in the 2019 auction. It is a wet-processed or washed version, in which the skin and pulp of the fruit is removed before the coffee is dried, resulting here in a particularly bright, high-toned up. JBC Coffee Roasters’ vision is simple: “let the coffee lead the way” through sourcing and roasting the best and most unique coffees available and rewarding the farmers who grow those coffees with substantial premiums.

Deeply sweet, elegantly rich. Mulberry, sandalwood, tangerine zest, jasmine, baking spices in aroma and cup. Sweetly tart in structure with high-toned, juicy acidity; plush, syrupy mouthfeel. The seemingly infinite finish fulfills the promise of the cup, leading with deep berry and citrus zest, rounding to floral-toned spice.
Notes
Yirgacheffe is a coffee region in southern Ethiopia that produces distinctive coffees from traditional varieties of Arabica long grown in the region. This is a “natural” or dry-processed version, meaning the beans were dried inside the fruit, encouraging a flavor profile that is less predictable and deeper than the more familiar wet-processed floral- and citrus-toned Yirgacheffe profile. Boulder, Colorado-based Dragonfly Coffee was named 2019 Micro-Roaster of the Year by Roast magazine. Visit www.dragonflycoffeeroasters.com or call 303-579-2154 for more information.

 
Bottom Line A complex, nuanced expression of a natural-processed Yirgacheffe coffee: fruit-forward, balanced, juicy and multi-layered — the fruit-centered genius of a natural conveyed with the completeness and inevitability of a classic.Explore Similar CoffeesClick here for more reviews from Dragonfly Coffee RoastersClick here for more information about coffees from Ethiopia

Notes
The cup profile of this coffee owes its originality to a complex, overlapping set of influences. First, tree variety: It was produced from distinctive-tasting indigenous varieties grown only in southern Ethiopia. Second, processing method: It is a “natural” or dry-processed coffee, meaning the beans were dried inside the fruit, encouraging a flavor profile that is often sweeter and deeper-toned than profiles associated with the more typical wet or “washed” process in which the soft fruit residue is removed before drying. Finally, the beans were exposed to cultured strains of bacteria extracted from the excrement of the civet cat, making this a laboratory version of the famous kopi luwak, the coffee passed through the intestines of a civet cat or luwak.

Blind Assessment
Lavish, captivatingly complex, deeply savory-sweet. Candycap mushroom, lilac, dark chocolate, dried coconut, frankincense in aroma and cup. Structurally, the savory component, which is typically an undertone, occupies the top of the aromatic and flavor range, with deep sweetness (fruit, florals) underneath. The mouthfeel is lively and richly syrupy. The seemingly eternal finish is a quiet mirror of the cup.
Notes
This exceptional coffee was selected as the No. 2 coffee on Coffee Review’s list of the Top 30 Coffees of 2019. Produced by the Kenya Coffee Research Institute at its demonstration Rukera Farm from trees of the SL28, SL34, K7, Ruiru 11 & Batian varieties of Arabica and processed by the wet, or washed, method.

Bottom Line One of the most striking coffees we’ve tested this year: levitatingly vibrant, profoundly integrated, with savory and sweet in deep harmony — and, paradoxically, both classic and original in its expression of the great Kenya style.Explore Similar CoffeesClick here for more reviews from JBC Coffee RoastersClick here for more information about coffees from KenyaVisit JBC Coffee Roasters

Evaluated as espresso. Exquisitely aromatic: high-toned, savory and impossibly floral. Toffee, dried black currant, myrrh, lavender, fine musk in aroma and small cup.

Blind Assessment
Evaluated as espresso. Cocoa-toned, deeply sweet. Cocoa powder, date, cedar, apricot, blood orange zest in aroma and small cup. Big, creamy mouthfeel; the finish is redolent of cocoa and citrus zest. In cappucino-scaled milk, cocoa tones are amplified, as are notes of stone fruit and citrus.
Notes
Produced by Verónica Lantan Vela de Acajabon at Finca El General from trees of the Typica and Caturra varieties of Arabica. This is a wet-processed or “washed” coffee, meaning the fruit skin and pulp were removed from the beans immediately after harvesting and before drying. Acatenango is the name of a coffee-growing municipality as well as a famous volcano overlooking the Antigua Valley of Guatemala. Kakalove Café is a nano-roaster located in the small city of Chia-Yi in Taiwan that strives to procure and roast the finest quality coffee.

Blind Assessment
A complex and overwhelming aromatic immersion. Pink bubblegum, winter spices, salted fudge, candied ginger, elderflower, herbal liqueur (yellow chartreuse?) in aroma and cup. The structure is dramatic: basic tastes are all disconcertingly intense, including sweet, salt and savory, yet they all somehow layer and satisfy. Very full and syrupy mouthfeel with a spicy drying edge. The finish is resonant, slightly bittersweet though chocolaty and rich.
Notes
This coffee is a collaboration between brothers Michael Johnson of JBC Coffee Roasters and Joseph Brodsky of the Panama producer Ninety Plus Coffee. It was produced entirely from trees of the celebrated Gesha variety of Arabica, and processed by an unconventional, proprietary variation of the wet method in which the whole coffee fruit is subjected to fermentation and washing before drying. JBC Coffee Roasters’ vision is simple: “let the coffee lead the way” through sourcing and roasting the best and most unique coffees available and rewarding the farmers who grow those coffees with substantial premiums.

Notes
Burundi is a small, landlocked country in the Great Lakes region of Central Africa. Most coffee is grown in the mountains of the north, bordering Rwanda. Benefiting from ideal growing conditions and large plantings of local strains of the heirloom Bourbon variety of Arabica, Burundi coffees have developed an excellent and growing reputation. Processed by the dry or “natural” method, meaning the beans were dried inside the fruit rather than after the fruit has been removed, as is the case with wet-processed or ""washed"" coffees. The company name Amavida combines the Spanish words for love and life, reflecting Amavida’s multifaceted commitment to fairness and fine coffee.

Vibrant, juicy, brightly fruit-toned and spicily floral. Wild strawberry, honey, dried gardenia, pistachio butter, pink peppercorn in aroma and cup. Sweet-tart structure with crisp, fresh acidity; viscous, lively mouthfeel. The finish amplifies rich floral and fruit with support from deep spice and earthy honey suggestions.
Notes
This coffee tied for the highest rating in a cupping of Hawai’i-grown coffees for Coffee Review’s May 2019 tasting report. This Ka’u coffee, comprised mostly of the Typica and Caturra varieties of Arabica, was processed using an unusual sequence of procedures. It was first fermented in the whole fruit with wine yeasts added to the tank, then dried in the whole fruit, making it, in effect, a fermented natural. Paradise Roasters specializes in micro-lot Arabica and Robusta coffees from Asia and other emerging origins. The company prides itself on quality and freshness, craft-roasting coffees in small batches only after orders are placed. Visit www.paradiseroasters.com or call 763-433-0626 for more information. 
Bottom Line Adventures in wine yeast: Two of Hawai’i’s (and the world’s) most common coffee varieties are elevated by an experimental fermentation method that results in a beverage that evokes Champagne — fruity but dry, not effervescent, but exceptionally vibrant.Explore Similar CoffeesClick here for more reviews from Paradise RoastersClick here for more information about coffees from HawaiiVisit Paradise Roasters

Notes
This coffee tied for the highest rating in a cupping of Hawai’i-grown coffees for Coffee Review’s May 2019 tasting report. Produced from trees of the rare Ethiopia-derived botanical variety Geisha (also Gesha) by Greg and Susy Stille at Monarch Coffee Estate. With its generally elongated beans and distinctive floral and crisp, often chocolaty cup, the Geisha/Gesha variety continues to distinguish itself as one of the world’s most unique coffees. This version was processed by the traditional wet or “washed” method, in which skin and fruit flesh are removed from the beans or seeds before they are dried. Founded in 1995 by Brooke McDonnell and Helen Russell, Equator Coffees operates retail stores in the bay area and provides coffee to hundreds of wholesale accounts. Equator has been a certified B-Corp since 2011, and its commitment to a sustainable, transparent approach spans more than two decades.

Notes
This coffee tied for the second-highest rating in a cupping of Hawai’i-grown coffees for Coffee Review’s May 2019 tasting report. Produced entirely of the Typica variety of Arabica and processed by the traditional wet or “washed” method, in which skin and fruit flesh are removed from the beans or seeds before they are dried. This sample also consists entirely of peaberries, a kind of bean that results when the coffee fruit develops only a single, oval bean rather than the usual pair of flat-sided beans. Peaberries produce a somewhat different (often better) cup than normal beans from the same crop, from which they may or may not be separated during grading. Big Island Coffee is an award-winning coffee roaster and coffee farm operated with hands-on passion by Kelleigh Stewart and Brandon von Damitz. Visit www.bigislandcoffeeroasters.com for more information.
Bottom Line The classically delicate, subtle Kona Typica profile is enhanced by the careful medium roast, as well as by the selection of peaberries only.Explore Similar CoffeesClick here for more reviews from Big Island Coffee RoastersClick here for more information about coffees from HawaiiVisit Big Island Coffee Roasters

This 100% Ka’u coffee was developed by Lorie Obra of Rusty’s, one of Ka’u’s best-known and most celebrated farms. Produced from trees of the traditional Typica variety and processed by the honey method, which means that the outer skin is removed as it is in the wet or “washed” process, but at least some of the sticky fruit residue is allowed to dry on the bean and later removed by machine along with the parchment skin. Visit www.rustyshawaiian.com or call 808-928-8916 for more information.
Bottom Line Richly floral and cleanly fruit-toned, an impressive and increasingly familiar style of natural- and honey-processed coffee from Ka’u producers.Explore Similar CoffeesClick here for more reviews from Rusty's HawaiianClick here for more information about coffees from Hawaii

Crisply sweet-tart, balanced. Rose hips, almond nougat, orange zest, apricot, cedar in aroma and cup. Sweet-toned structure with gentle, round acidity; velvety-smooth mouthfeel. The finish consolidates to pretty notes of nougat and apricot, with a hint of cedar. 
Notes
This coffee tied for the third-highest rating in a cupping of Hawai’i-grown coffees for Coffee Review’s May 2019 tasting report. Produced by Rusty’s Hawaiian entirely of the Typica variety of Arabica and processed by the dry-processed or “natural” method, meaning the beans were dried inside the fruit rather than after the fruit has been removed, as is the case with wet-processed or “washed” coffees. Three Chairs Coffee was established in 2014 by Turgay YILDIZLI, the 2013 World Cezve/Ibrik Champion. Three Chairs offers coffees roasted to order for either Turkish or filtered coffee and is on a mission to improve the quality of Turkish coffee and introduce it to the specialty coffee world. The company has partnered with Rusty's Hawaiian for several years, highlighting Ka’u natural-processed coffees. Visit www.specialtyturkishcoffee.com for more information.
Bottom Line The fruit typical of a natural-processed coffee is pleasingly balanced here by deep nougat, citrus zest, and rich aromatic wood notes.Explore Similar CoffeesClick here for more reviews from Three Chairs Specialty Turkish CoffeeClick here for more information about coffees from Hawaii

Very sweet, richly perfumed, wood-framed. Pipe-tobacco, lychee fruit, spice box, freesia-like flowers, amber and musk in aroma and cup. Richly, densely composed structure, crisply tart acidity. Impressively syrupy-smooth mouthfeel. The finish consolidates pleasantly into a slightly drying though rich-toned, spicy tobacco.
Notes
Although Ethiopia is the botanical home of Coffea Arabica, Yemen introduced the beverage to the rest of the world in the 16th and 17th centuries, and Yemen coffee is still grown from ancient heirloom cultivars of arabica on stone-walled terraces ringing fortress-like mountaintop villages. All Yemen coffees are natural-processed, or dried in the whole fruit. This particular Yemen may owe its striking aromatics to ancient tree varieties, but its clean elegance is most likely owing to the efforts of exporter Rayyan Mill in the capital of Sana’a, which has worked with farmers to improve picturesque but often haphazard harvesting and drying procedures. Baba Java is a specialty roaster and cafe retailer located in Hoover Alabama, who strives to provide the best coffee experience at every step.

Very sweetly tart, floral-prominent and rich-toned. Lemon custard, red currant jam, tea rose, maple syrup and dried coconut in aroma and cup. Delightfully crisp and tart, though cohesively resonant in structure; very lightly though buoyantly syrupy in mouthfeel. The finish is pert and satisfying, with a lingering sweet crispness and a long aromatic trajectory.

Sweetly tart, spice-toned. Dried black cherry, lantana, pipe tobacco, allspice, cedar in aroma and cup. Tart-leaning structure with brisk acidity; plush, syrupy mouthfeel. In the quiet, gently drying finish, fruit and florals recede and savory/spice notes, specifically pipe tobacco and cedar, are amplified.
Notes
This nano-lot, imported by Paradise Coffee, represents a coffee produced in the Sabah state of Malaysia, across the South China Sea from mainland Malaysia, on the island of Borneo. Malaysian coffee is typically associated with the Robusta and Liberica species, not the Arabica varieties that are most prominent in specialty coffee, making this the first Malaysia-grown Arabica coffee ever to be roasted and sold outside of that country. It is a mix of varieties of Arabica and is processed by the double-washed method. Paradise Roasters specializes in micro-lot Arabica and Robusta coffees from Asia and other emerging origins. The company prides itself on quality and freshness, craft-roasting coffees in small batches only after orders are placed. Visit www.paradiseroasters.com or call 763-433-0626 for more information.

Blind Assessment
Richly sweet, cocoa- and fruit-toned. Concord grape, cocoa nib, sandalwood, maple syrup, lilac in aroma and cup. Sweet-toned structure with bright, juicy acidity; plush, syrupy mouthfeel. Resonant, flavor-saturated finish that highlights fruit and cocoa tones.

Notes
This exceptional coffee was selected as the No. 14 coffee on Coffee Review’s list of the Top 30 Coffees of 2019. Produced from trees of the rare Ethiopia-derived botanical variety Gesha (also Geisha). With its generally elongated beans and distinctive floral and crisp, often chocolaty cup, the Gesha variety continues to distinguish itself as one of the world’s most unique coffees. Although the Gesha variety originated in Ethiopia, it was “discovered” by the coffee world in 2004 growing in Boquete, Panama, and Panama continues to dominate the expanding world of Gesha. This particular version, however, is the outcome of efforts to commercialize Gesha in the region from which it originally came. Processed by the dried-in-the-fruit or natural method. Small Eyes Café is a small, family-owned coffee shop in Yilan, Taiwan, specializing in artisanally roasted specialty coffee and homemade desserts. Visit https://www.facebook.com/Smalleyescafe for more information.
Bottom Line A superbly structured natural-processed Ethiopia Gesha that leads with clean fruit tones supported by rich cocoa and deep florals.Explore Similar CoffeesClick here for more reviews from Small Eyes CaféClick here for more information about coffees from Ethiopia

Roundly savory, sweet, quiet. Almond, pine, lightly cooked taro with hints of orange zest and plum blossom in aroma and cup. Gently sweet-savory in structure; very lightly satiny in mouthfeel. The finish is lightly crisp with pungent hints of pine.


Notes
Produced from trees of local strains of the heirloom Bourbon variety of Arabica. Epiphanie Mukashyaka established the now famous Bufcafe washing station or wet mill following the Rwandan genocide. Processed by a Rwandan version of the wet or “washed” method, in which skin and fruit flesh are removed from the beans or seeds before they are dried.

Notes
This exceptional coffee was selected as the No. 3 coffee on Coffee Review’s list of the Top 30 Coffees of 2019. Comprised entirely of beans from the rare Sudan Rume, a presumably very old variety of Arabica originally selected from wild trees growing on the Boma Plateau of Sudan, close to the border with Ethiopia.

Delicate, sweetly pungent. Apple-brandy reduction, hazelnut, lime zest, freesia and fir in aroma and cup. Low-toned, savory-edged structure with gently tart acidity; smooth, lightly creamy mouthfeel. Quietly rich-toned finish, with a hint of tart apple in the long.
Notes
Until 2015, Federacion Nacional de Cafeteros, the governing body of Colombian Coffee, only allowed exports of washed coffees. This coffee is processed by the honey method, which means that the outer skin is removed as it is in the wet or “washed” process, but at least some of the sticky fruit residue is allowed to dry on the bean and later removed by machine along with the parchment skin.

Sweetly pungent, earthy. Moist, fresh-fallen leaves, orange zest, fresh-cut pine, cocoa, lily in aroma and cup. Richly tart in structure, with a savory edge. Light but buoyant mouthfeel. The finish consolidates around cocoa, orange and a deep, lily-like floral note. 
Notes
This coffee tied for the fourth-highest rating in a cupping of coffees from Sumatra for Coffee Review’s April 2019 tasting report. Coffees like this one from the northern part of the Indonesian island of Sumatra are valued for their complex earth and fruit notes that appear to result largely from unorthodox fruit removal and drying practices called “wet-hulling.” Produced by the Ketiara Cooperative, the only women-led cooperative in Indonesia, with 867 small-holding members. Certified at origin as fair-trade (by Fairtrade International) and organically grown, but not so labeled. Barrington Coffee is an artisan roaster dedicated to elite coffees, fresh delivery and roasting that foregrounds the coffee and not the roast. Visit www.barringtoncoffee.com or call 800-528-0998 for more information.
Bottom Line Attractive choice for lovers of the traditional Sumatra wet-hulled profile: earthy, pungent, yet bright, offering bonus satisfaction for supporters of progressive, women-led cooperatives.Explore Similar CoffeesClick here for more reviews from Barrington Coffee RoastingClick here for more information about coffees from SumatraVisit Barrington Coffee Roasting

Notes
This coffee tied for the third-highest rating in a cupping of coffees from Sumatra for Coffee Review’s April 2019 tasting report.

Notes
This coffee tied for the third-highest rating in a cupping of coffees from Sumatra for Coffee Review’s April 2019 tasting report.

Notes
Southern Ethiopia coffees like this one are largely produced from distinctive indigenous Ethiopian varieties of Arabica long grown in the region.

Blind Assessment
Evaluated as espresso. Graceful, complex, balanced. Pomegranate, dark chocolate, jasmine, pink peppercorn, fresh-cut cedar in aroma and small cup. Plush, satiny mouthfeel; crisp, spiced-toned, chocolaty finish. In three parts milk, notes of dark chocolate and deep jasmine resonate, with pleasing undertones of aromatic wood.
Notes
This exceptional coffee was selected as the No. 25 coffee on Coffee Review’s list of the Top 30 Coffees of 2019. Produced at Cerro Las Ranas farm from trees of the Bourbon variety of Arabica. Processed by the honey method, which means that the outer skin is removed as it is in the wet or “washed” process, but at least some of the sticky fruit residue is allowed to dry on the bean and later removed by machine along with the parchment skin. Kakalove Café is a nano-roaster located in the small city of Chia-Yi in Taiwan that strives to procure and roast the finest quality coffee.

The hint of sweet ferment throughout the profile is amplified in the resounding finish, which is both sweet and appealingly savory, with notes suggesting a richly pleasing balsamic vinegar reduction.
Notes
This coffee tied for the highest rating in a cupping of coffees from Peru, Bolivia and Ecuador for Coffee Review’s March 2019 tasting report. Produced by the Rodriguez family of Finca Alasitas entirely from the trees of the celebrated Geisha (also spelled Gesha) variety of Arabica. This sample consists entirely of peaberries, a kind of bean that results when the coffee fruit develops only a single, oval bean rather than the usual pair of flat-sided beans. Peaberries produce a somewhat different (often better) cup than normal beans from the same crop, from which they may or may not be separated during grading. This is a dry-processed or “natural” coffee, meaning the beans were dried inside the fruit rather than after the fruit has been removed, as is the case with wet-processed or “washed” coffees. Self-taught roaster Sean Tung is interested in bringing medium-roast coffee with depth and balance to his customer at Sucré Beans, a roastery and café in Taipei.

This coffee tied for the highest rating in a cupping of coffees from Peru, Bolivia and Ecuador for Coffee Review’s March 2019 tasting report. Produced by Guillermo Ortiz of Finca Victoria, entirely from the Typica Mejorado variety of Arabica, in the Pichincha Province of North-central Ecuador. This is a wet-processed or “washed” coffee, meaning the fruit skin and pulp were removed from the beans immediately after harvesting and before drying. Paradise Roasters specializes in micro-lot Arabica and Robusta coffees from Asia and other emerging origins. The company prides itself on quality and freshness, craft-roasting coffees in small batches only after orders are placed. Visit www.paradiseroasters.com or call 763-433-0626 for more information.

Richly bittersweet, complexly fruit-toned. Chocolate fudge, dried mulberry, candied pink grapefruit zest, pistachio brittle, wisteria-like flowers in aroma and cup. Deeply sweet structure with high-toned, lively acidity; velvety mouthfeel. The finish centers around notes of chocolate fudge and dried mulberry, with a pleasingly bittersweet pink grapefruit throughline. 
Notes
The Yirgacheffe region produces distinctive coffees from traditional varieties of Arabica long grown in the area. This is a “natural” or dry-processed version, meaning the beans were dried inside the fruit rather than after the fruit has been removed, as is the case with wet-processed or “washed” coffees.  Boulder, Colorado-based Dragonfly Coffee was named 2019 Micro-Roaster of the Year by Roast magazine. Visit dragonflycoffeeroasters.com or call 303-579-2154 for more information.
Bottom Line A deeply satisfying, impeccably clean natural Ethiopia cup: a chocolate bomb lifted by pretty notes of dried berries and high-toned florals.Explore Similar CoffeesClick here for more reviews from Dragonfly Coffee RoastersClick here for more information about coffees from Ethiopia

Deep, chocolaty, cleanly fruit-toned. Dark chocolate, cedar, black cherry, magnolia, molasses in aroma and cup. Sweetly tart structure with gentle, rounded acidity. Consolidates to resonant chocolate and cherry in the finish.
Notes
The components of this blend are certified organically grown and Fair Trade certified, meaning they were purchased from small-holding farmers at a “fair” or economically sustainable price. This version of the ancient Mocha-Java blend combines a traditionally processed, wet-hulled Sumatra in place of the original Java and replaces the Yemen Mocha with a similar “natural” or dried-in-the-fruit coffee from Ethiopia. One of the country’s pioneering socially and environmentally progressive roasters, Thanksgiving aimed to combine coffee quality with social and environmental responsibility many years before the latter preoccupations became fashionable.

Nuanced, layered, richly sweet-savory. Fine musk, wisteria-like flowers, dark chocolate, pipe tobacco, black cherry in aroma and cup. Balanced sweet-tart-savory structure with juicy, vibrant acidity; plush, syrupy mouthfeel. The finish is resonant, flavor-saturated, and impressively long.
Notes
This coffee was grown by indigenous Batak people, who have been involved in coffee production since the practice was brought to Sumatra by the Dutch in the late 19th century. Coffees from the northern part of the Indonesian island of Sumatra are admired for their complex aromatic wood and fruit notes that appear to result largely from unorthodox fruit removal and drying practices called “wet hulling.” This is a particularly refined example of the type, developed and imported by Olam Specialty Coffee. Founded by roaster Heather Brisson-Lutz in 2018, Origin Coffee Roasters highlights the origin of each carefully selected coffee with a roast profile that befits the specific characteristics of the green.

High-toned, richly sweet-savory. Red currant, dark chocolate, tangerine zest, hop flowers, sandalwood in aroma and cup. Richly bittersweet structure with vibrant, juicy acidity; plush, syrupy mouthfeel. Deep, flavor-saturated finish with red currant and dark chocolate carrying well into the long.
Notes
This exceptional coffee was selected as the No. 5 coffee on Coffee Review’s list of the Top 30 Coffees of 2019. This coffee also earned the highest rating in a cupping of coffees from New England roasters for Coffee Review’s February 2019 tasting report. Produced entirely from trees of the Bourbon variety of Arabica, this is a wet-processed or “washed” coffee, meaning the fruit skin and pulp were removed from the beans immediately after harvesting and before drying.  This particular sample consists entirely of peaberries, a kind of bean that results when the coffee fruit develops only a single, oval bean rather than the usual pair of flat-sided beans. Peaberries produce a somewhat different (often better) cup than normal beans from the same crop, from which they may or may not be separated during grading.

Delicately fruit-toned, richly cocoa-driven. Ripe strawberry, dark chocolate,  almond, freesia-like flowers, a hint of wine barrel in aroma and cup. Sweet-tart structure with crisp, high-toned acidity; full, syrupy mouthfeel. The flavor-saturated finish sustains all of the aroma and flavor notes promised by the cup.
Notes
This exceptional coffee was selected as the No. 9 coffee on Coffee Review’s list of the Top 30 Coffees of 2019. Bourbon Pointu, botanical name var. Laurina, is a rare variety of Arabica that is a natural mutation of the famous Bourbon variety, first selected on Reunion Island in the Indian Ocean. The Bourbon Pointu is famous for its natural low levels of caffeine, bean shape (small and tending to be pointed at the ends, hence “pointu”), and pungently fruit-toned, Bourbon-like cup. This version was produced in Kona and is a dry-processed or “natural” coffee, meaning the beans were dried inside the fruit rather than after the fruit has been removed, as is the case with wet-processed or “washed” coffees. Hula Daddy is a boutique coffee producer with farms at the 1,400 and 2,500 foot levels of the Mount Hualalai volcano near the northern end of the Kona growing district, five minutes above the town of Kailua-Kona. This rare coffee is only available on the Hula Daddy website through their allocation list. Visit www.huladaddy.com or call 888-553-2339 for more information.
Bottom Line A bright, juicy, berry-toned Hawaii cup from the extremely rare tree variety Pointu Laurina, worth a splurge for its clean fruit and sweet, cocoa-laden richness.Explore Similar CoffeesClick here for more reviews from Hula Daddy Kona CoffeeClick here for more information about coffees from HawaiiVisit Hula Daddy Kona Coffee

Bright, crisply sweet, chocolaty. Lemon blossom, nougat, roasted cacao nib, pomegranate, violet in aroma and cup. Balanced, sweetly tart structure with juicy, bright acidity; satiny-smooth mouthfeel. The resonant finish centers around cocoa and lightly-expressed citrus notes. 
Notes
Yirgacheffe is a coffee region in southern Ethiopia that produces distinctive coffees from traditional indigenous varieties of Arabica long grown in the region. Yirgacheffe coffees like this one processed by the wet or washed method (fruit skin and pulp are removed before drying) typically express great aromatic complexity and intensity with a particular emphasis on floral notes. Paradise Roasters specializes in micro-lot Arabica and Robusta coffees from Asia and other emerging origins. The company prides itself on quality and freshness, craft-roasting coffees in small batches only after orders are placed. Visit www.paradiseroasters.com for more information.

 
Bottom Line A high-toned, juicy Yirgacheffe cup, classic in its balance of bright fruit, sweet floral and cocoa tones.Explore Similar CoffeesClick here for more reviews from Paradise RoastersClick here for more information about coffees from EthiopiaVisit Paradise Roasters

Blind Assessment
Wild, unruly, utterly brilliant and original. Intensely and intricately floral-toned: opulent lily through delicate violet with a shifting bouquet of possibilities between. At the heart of aroma and flavor is a cidery, brandyish compote of fruit--apple, passion fruit, lychee--rounded by a fine, cocoa-toned chocolate. The structure is shifty, simultaneously sweet, crisply bitterish and tart, the mouthfeel plump and syrupy. The finish rings on with continuing layers of fruit, flowers, cocoa and coconut.   
Notes
The intensity and complexity of this extraordinary coffee are owing both to tree variety and processing method. The variety is the rare Ethiopia-derived botanical variety Gesha (also spelled Geisha). With its generally elongated beans and distinctive floral and crisp, often chocolaty cup, the Gesha continues to distinguish itself as one of the world’s most unique coffee varieties. Joseph Brodsky and his colleagues processed this Gesha at Ninety Plus Gesha Estates in Panama using a refined and innovative processing procedure involving fermenting the whole, freshly-picked coffee fruit at high temperatures using a special yeast strain before drying it, still in the whole fruit. Bird Rock Coffee Roasters is a retailer and wholesaler focused on organic and socially responsible coffees; it was awarded the “2012 Micro-Roaster of the Year” title by Roast Magazine. Visit www.birdrockcoffee.com or call 858-551-1707 for more information.
Bottom Line The grand floral and cocoa complexity of the Gesha variety is amplified here by an innovative processing method that turns mouthfeel big and buoyant and the fruit lush, intense and giddily brandy-toned.Explore Similar CoffeesClick here for more reviews from Bird Rock Coffee RoastersClick here for more information about coffees from PanamaVisit Bird Rock Coffee Roasters

Rich-toned, crisply sweet. Narcissus, plum, cedar, cashew butter, honey in aroma and cup. Sweet-tart structure with soft acidity; satiny-smooth mouthfeel. The finish resonates with plum and narcissus notes in the short, consolidating to cashew and cedar in the long.
Notes
This coffee tied for the fifth-highest rating in a tasting of holiday coffees for Coffee Review‘s December 2018 tasting report. Southern Ethiopia coffees are largely produced from distinctive indigenous varieties of Arabica long grown in the region, and when processed like this one by the wet or washed method (fruit skin and pulp is removed before drying), they typically express great aromatic complexity and intensity with a particular emphasis on floral notes. Visit www.steadfast.coffee for more information.
Bottom Line A fine Ethiopia wet-processed cup: balanced and engaging, with stone fruit and sweet florals as throughlines.Explore Similar CoffeesClick here for more reviews from Steadfast CoffeeClick here for more information about coffees from Ethiopia

Notes
This coffee tied for the fifth-highest rating in a tasting of holiday coffees for Coffee Review‘s December 2018 tasting report. Produced by Rodolfo Huezo Pineda entirely of the Pacamara variety of Arabica. The Pacamara is a big-beaned hybrid of the Bourbon-related Pacas and the huge-beaned Maragogipe, a mutant of the ancient Typica variety. This is a wet-processed or “washed” coffee, meaning the fruit skin and pulp were removed from the beans immediately after harvesting and before drying. Speckled Ax is a roaster based in Portland, Maine, specializing in high-quality certified organic and small-lot coffees. The company roasts in a vintage wood-fired Petroncini roaster with the goal of highlighting each coffee’s best attributes. Visit www.speckledax.com for more information.

This coffee tied for the third-highest rating in a tasting of holiday coffees for Coffee Review‘s December 2018 tasting report.  Produced from trees of the rare Ethiopia-derived botanical variety Gesha (also spelled Geisha) by Pablo Guerrero.

This is a dry-processed or “natural” version, meaning the beans were dried inside the fruit rather than after the fruit has been removed, as is the case with wet-processed or “washed” coffees. The majority of Gesha coffees are grown in the Boquete region of Panama, but there is increased experimentation with this variety throughout Latin America, especially Colombia, where this exceptional version was grown.

Big, round, deeply and pungently layered. Fragrant cedar, lavender, baker’s chocolate, Concord grape, a hint of mace in aroma and cup. Bittersweet and rich in structure; fat and plush in mouthfeel with a drying edge. Concord grape and cedar dominate in a continuing pungent but quite sweet finish. 
Notes
Produced from trees of the rare Ethiopia-derived botanical variety Geisha (also spelled Gesha) on the Chiari family’s Finca Lerida Esplenderosa in Jaramillo under the management of family member Sonia Amoruso. With its elongated beans and distinctive cup, the Geisha variety continues to distinguish itself as one of the world’s most unique coffees. In all honey processing methods, skins are removed, but some sweet pulp or fruit flesh (“honey”) is allowed to adhere to the beans during drying. In the black honey variation, virtually all of the pulp is allowed to dry on the beans and the beans may be subject to a particularly slow drying process, often netting a deep, pungent profile.

Spice-toned, deep, resonant. Dried persimmon, perique (fermented) tobacco, cinnamon, dark chocolate, gardenia-like flowers in aroma and cup. Sweet-savory structure with engagingly citrusy acidity; plush, syrupy mouthfeel. The finish leads with dried persimmon and dark chocolate, followed by pipe tobacco and cinnamon.
Notes
Produced from trees of the admired SL-28 and SL-34 varieties of Arabica. Despite grower discontent and urban encroachment on prime coffee lands, Kenya continues to produce some of the world’s most elegant and distinctive coffees. This sample consists entirely of peaberries, a kind of bean that results when the coffee fruit develops only a single, oval bean rather than the usual pair of flat-sided beans. Peaberries produce a somewhat different (often better) cup than normal beans from the same crop, from which they may or may not be separated during grading.

Notes
Finca El Aguila is owned by Mauricio Ariz and his sons. It occupies 63 hectares in Cantón Ojo de Agua, municipality of Chalchuapa, near the Santa Ana Volcano. A small portion of the farm is devoted to the production of SL 28, the tree variety most responsible the great coffees of Kenya.

Evaluated as espresso. Crisp, chocolate-toned and cedary. Dark chocolate, pecan, gently scorched cedar, ripe banana, tangerine zest in aroma and small cup. Lightly syrupy mouthfeel; roundly bittersweet in the finish: chocolate, cedar, tangerine. Cedar dominates in three parts milk, quietly enveloped by chocolate and ripe banana.

Enchantingly rich, intensely floral, unique. Dried black cherry, tea rose, Cognac, chocolate fudge, gently scorched almond wood in aroma and cup. Deeply sweet-savory in structure with crisp, apple-toned acidity; plump, syrupy mouthfeel. Exceptionally long finish that carries over all the aroma and flavor notes from the cup, plus an umami intrigue akin to candied bacon.
Notes
This exceptional coffee was selected as the No. 1 coffee on Coffee Review’s list of the Top 30 Coffees of 2018. Mocca (also spelled Moka and Mokka) is a famous variety of Arabica that reached Kaanapali, Hawaii from Brazil. Current thinking in the technical coffee community is that it originated in the Reunion Islands as a mutant of the great Bourbon variety. It may well have originated in Yemen, however, where varieties displaying the identical, very unusual bean size and shape are known as Ismaili, as well as by other local names. This Mocca was processed by the dry or “natural” method, meaning the beans were dried inside the fruit rather than after the fruit has been removed, as is the case with wet-processed or “washed” coffees. This rare coffee with its tiny beans and striking cup is available only on the Hula Daddy website through their allocation list. Hula Daddy is a boutique coffee producer with farms at the 1,400 and 2,500 foot levels of the Mount Hualalai volcano near the northern end of the Kona growing district, five minutes above the town of Kailua-Kona. This coffee was produced at the higher elevation Hula Daddy farm. Visit www.huladaddy.com or call 888-553-2339 for more information.

Yirgacheffe coffees like this one are largely produced from traditional Ethiopian varieties of Arabica long grown in the region.

Blind Assessment
Rich, high-toned, sweetly herbaceous. Lemon verbena, roasted almond, black cherry, narcissus, black peppercorn in aroma and cup. Savory-sweet structure with high-toned, lively acidity; plush, syrupy mouthfeel. The finish leads with black cherry and narcissus in the short, with notes of almond and peppercorn in the long, and an undercurrent of lemon verbena throughout.
Notes
Produced at Hacienda Copey (Finca Don Antonio) from trees of the rare Ethiopia-derived botanical variety Geisha (also spelled Gesha) by the Lamastus family at Elida Estate. With its generally elongated beans and distinctive floral and crisp, often chocolaty cup, the Geisha/Gesha variety continues to distinguish itself as one of the world’s most unique coffees. Processed by the honey method, which means that the outer skin is removed as it is in the wet or “washed” process, but at least some of the sticky fruit residue is allowed to dry on the bean and later removed by machine along with the parchment skin. Dragonfly Coffee is a Boulder, Colorado-based micro-roaster that produces high-quality coffees and supports worthy causes.

Notes
This coffee earned the highest rating in a cupping of coffees from big-bean varieties for Coffee Review’s November 2018 tasting report. Produced at Finca La Hermosa entirely of the Pacamara variety of Arabica. The Pacamara is a big-beaned hybrid of the Bourbon-related Pacas and the huge-beaned Maragogipe, itself a mutant of the ancient Typica variety. This is a dry-processed or “natural” version, meaning the beans were dried inside the fruit rather than after the soft fruit residue has been removed, as is the case with wet-processed or “washed” coffees.

Sweetly herbaceous, richly cocoa-toned. Baker’s chocolate, lemon verbena, toffee, allspice, hazelnut in aroma and cup. Sweet-toned structure with brisk acidity; velvety mouthfeel. The finish leads with lemon verbena and toffee in the short, segueing to spice-toned chocolate and hazelnut in the long.
Notes
Southern Ethiopia coffees like this one are largely produced from distinctive traditional Ethiopian varieties of Arabica long grown in the region. This is a dry-processed or “natural” coffee, meaning the beans were dried inside the fruit rather than after the fruit has been removed, as is the case with wet-processed or “washed” coffees. Steady State Roasting is an award-winning small-batch roastery dedicated to the craft and care of providing specialty coffee. The company takes pride in sourcing unique, high-quality coffee direct from farmers so that customers can enjoy fine coffee at home or in the Steady State tasting room in downtown Carlsbad, California.

Notes
Produced by Anny Ruth Pimentel-Courson entirely from trees of the heirloom Bourbon variety of Arabica and processed by the black honey method. With all honey processing methods, some sweet pulp or fruit flesh (“honey”) is allowed to adhere to the beans during drying. In the black honey variation, the beans are subjected to a slower drying process than is the case with yellow or red honey processing.

Haraz (also Haraaz, other spellings) is a celebrated coffee growing region in north-central Yemen, west of the capital of San’a. Although Ethiopia is the botanical home of Coffea arabica, Yemen introduced the beverage to the rest of the world in the 16th and 17th centuries, and Yemeni coffee is still grown from ancient cultivars and sun-dried, often on the roofs of stone houses. Direct Coffee, founded in 2005, is a roastery located in the scenic city of Hsinchu, Taiwan. For the past 13 years, Direct Coffee has specialized in searching for high-quality coffee beans and roasting them to display their unique and distinctive characteristics.

Delicate, richly sweet-savory. Toffee, tamarind, roasted cacao nib, star jasmine, almond in aroma and cup. Savory-sweet in structure with balanced, round acidity; plush syrupy mouthfeel. The crisply sweet finish is floral-toned, supported by notes of cocoa nib and toffee.
Notes

Rich-toned, cleanly fruit-forward, intricately balanced. Concord grape, pungent myrrh, roasted cacao nib, honeysuckle, candy cap mushroom in aroma and cup. Deeply sweet-tart structure with bright, juicy acidity; plush, syrupy mouthfeel. The resonant, flavor-saturated finish rings on with all of the notes from the cup.
Notes
This exceptional coffee was selected as the No. 16 coffee on Coffee Review’s list of the Top 30 Coffees of 2018.  This coffee earned the highest rating in a cupping of coffees from U.S. Mountain States roasters for Coffee Review’s October 2018 tasting report. Coffee from trees of the botanical variety Geisha (also Gesha) grown on Hacienda La Esmeralda in Panama first introduced this extraordinary variety of Arabica to the world. With its bold, boat-shaped beans and distinctive floral and crisply cacao-toned cup, the Geisha/Gesha continues to be one of the world’s most celebrated and sought-after coffee varieties, and the Esmeralda versions remain among the most authentic. This is a dry-processed or “natural” version, meaning the beans were dried inside the fruit rather than after the soft fruit residue has been removed, as is the case with wet-processed or “washed” coffees. Dragonfly Coffee is a Boulder, Colorado-based micro-roaster that produces high-quality coffees and supports worthy causes.
